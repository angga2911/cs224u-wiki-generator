The '''Battle of Missionary Ridge''' was fought November 25, 1863, as part of the [[Chattanooga Campaign]] of the [[American Civil War]]. Following the [[Union Army|Union]] victory in the [[Battle of Lookout Mountain]] on November 24, Union forces under [[Major general (United States)|Maj. Gen.]] [[Ulysses S. Grant]] assaulted [[Missionary Ridge]] and defeated the [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] [[Army of Tennessee]], commanded by [[General (CSA)|Gen.]] [[Braxton Bragg]].

In the morning, elements of the [[Army of the Tennessee]] commanded by Maj. Gen. [[William T. Sherman]] attempted to capture the northern end of Missionary Ridge, Tunnel Hill, but were stopped by fierce resistance from the Confederate divisions of Maj. Gen. [[Patrick R. Cleburne]], [[William H.T. Walker]], and [[Carter L. Stevenson]]. In the afternoon, Grant was concerned that Bragg was reinforcing his right flank at Sherman's expense. He ordered the [[Army of the Cumberland]], commanded by Maj. Gen. [[George H. Thomas]], to move forward and seize the Confederate line of rifle pits on the valley floor, and stop there to await further orders. The Union soldiers moved forward and quickly pushed the Confederates from the first line of rifle pits but were then subjected to a punishing fire from the Confederate lines up the ridge.

At this point, the Union soldiers continued the attack against the remaining lines, seeking refuge near the crest of the ridge (the top line of rifle pits were sited on the actual crest rather than the [[military crest]] of the ridge, leaving blind spots). This second advance was taken up by the commanders on the spot, but also by some of the soldiers who, on their own, sought shelter from the fire further up the slope. The Union advance was disorganized but effective; finally overwhelming and scattering what ought to have been, as General Grant himself believed, an impregnable Confederate line. In combination with an advance from the southern end of the ridge by divisions under Maj. Gen. [[Joseph Hooker]], the Union Army routed Bragg's army, which retreated to [[Dalton, Georgia]], ending the siege of Union forces in [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]].

==Background==
{{Further2|[[Chattanooga Campaign]]}}
After their disastrous defeat at the [[Battle of Chickamauga]], the 40,000 men of the Union [[Army of the Cumberland]] under Maj. Gen. [[William Rosecrans]] retreated to Chattanooga. Confederate General Braxton Bragg's [[Army of Tennessee]] besieged the city, threatening to starve the Union forces into surrender. Bragg's troops established themselves on [[Missionary Ridge]] and [[Lookout Mountain]], both of which had excellent views of the city, the [[Tennessee River]] flowing through the city, and the Union's supply lines. The only supply line that was not controlled by the Confederates was a roundabout, tortuous course nearly 60 miles long over Walden's Ridge from [[Bridgeport, Alabama]]. Heavy rains began to fall in late September, washing away long stretches of the mountain roads. On October 1, Maj. Gen. [[Joseph Wheeler]]'s Confederate cavalry intercepted and severely damaged a train of 800 wagons&amp;mdash;burning hundreds of the wagons, and shooting or sabering hundreds of mules&amp;mdash;at the start of his [[Wheeler's October 1863 Raid|October 1863 Raid]] through Tennessee to sever Rosecrans's supply line. Toward the end of October, Federal soldiers' rations were &quot;four cakes of hard bread and a quarter pound of pork&quot; every three days.&lt;ref&gt;Eicher, pp. 577-90; Lamers, pp. 375-76; Korn, pp. 78-80; Cozzens, pp. 11, 17-19; Esposito, map 115; Eicher, pp. 596, 600.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Union government sent reinforcements: Maj. Gen. [[Joseph Hooker]] with 15,000 men in two corps from the [[Army of the Potomac]] in Virginia and Maj. Gen. [[William T. Sherman]] with 20,000 men from [[Vicksburg, Mississippi]]. On October 17, Maj. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant received command of the Western armies, designated the [[Military Division of the Mississippi]]; he moved to reinforce Chattanooga and replaced Rosecrans with Maj. Gen. [[George Henry Thomas|George H. Thomas]].&lt;ref&gt;McDonough, pp. 49-54; Woodworth, ''Six Armies'', p. 151; Smith, pp. 264-65; Lamers, p. 393; Eicher, p. 595; Korn, pp. 83-89; Cozzens, pp. 18, 2-6; Esposito, map 115.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Thomas launched a surprise amphibious landing at Brown's Ferry on October 27 that opened the Tennessee River by linking up his Army of the Cumberland with Hooker's relief column southwest of the city, thus allowing supplies and reinforcements to flow into Chattanooga over what was called the &quot;Cracker Line&quot;. In response, Bragg ordered [[Lieutenant General (CSA)|Lt. Gen.]] [[James Longstreet]] to force the Federals out of Lookout Valley. The ensuing [[Battle of Wauhatchie]] (October 28&amp;ndash;29) was one of the war's few battles fought exclusively at night. The Confederates were repulsed, and the Cracker Line was secured.&lt;ref&gt;McDonough, pp. 76-94; Woodworth, ''Six Armies'', pp. 158-67; Connelly, pp. 258-51; Kennedy, p. 242; Korn, pp. 90-94; Eicher, pp. 602-03; Esposito, map 116; Cozzens, pp. 61-65, 72-73, 80-101.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sherman arrived with his 20,000 men of the [[Army of the Tennessee]] in mid-November. Grant, Sherman, and Thomas planned a double envelopment of Bragg's force, with the main attack by Sherman against the northern end of Missionary Ridge, supported by Thomas in the center and by Hooker, who would capture Lookout Mountain and then move across the Chattanooga Valley to [[Rossville, Georgia]], and cut off the Confederate retreat route to the south.&lt;ref&gt;Woodworth, ''Six Armies'', p. 172; McDonough, pp. 108-09; Kennedy, p. 245; Liddell Hart, pp. 213-14.&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 23, Sherman's force was ready to cross the Tennessee River. Grant ordered Thomas to advance halfway to Missionary Ridge on a [[reconnaissance in force]] to determine the strength of the Confederate line, hoping to ensure that Bragg would not withdraw his forces and move in the direction of [[Knoxville, Tennessee]], where Maj. Gen. [[Ambrose Burnside]] was being threatened by a Confederate force under [[Lieutenant General (CSA)|Lt. Gen.]] [[James Longstreet]]. Thomas sent over 14,000 men toward a minor hill named Orchard Knob and overran the Confederate defenders. Grant changed his orders and instructed Thomas's men to dig in and hold the position.&lt;ref&gt;McDonough, pp. 110-13; Cozzens, pp. 128-35; Woodworth, ''Six Armies'', p. 180.&lt;/ref&gt;

Surprised by Thomas's move and realizing that his center and right might be more vulnerable than he had thought, Bragg quickly readjusted his strategy. Bragg assigned Col. Warren Grigsby's brigade of Kentucky cavalry to picket the Tennessee river northeast of Chattanooga and ordered Brig. Gen. [[Marcus Joseph Wright]] to bring his brigade of Tennessee infantry from Cleveland, Tennessee, by train to Chickamauga Station. He recalled all units he had recently ordered to Knoxville if they were within a day's march. Maj. Gen. [[Patrick R. Cleburne]]'s division returned after dark from Chickamauga Station, interrupting the process of boarding the trains. Bragg began to reduce the strength on his left by withdrawing Maj. Gen. [[William H. T. Walker]]'s division from the base of Lookout Mountain and placing them on the far right of Missionary Ridge, just south of Tunnel Hill. He assigned Lt. Gen. [[William J. Hardee]] to command his now critical right flank, turning over the left flank to Maj. Gen. [[Carter L. Stevenson]]. Bragg's concern for his right proved justified and his decisions were fortuitous. In the center, Maj. Gen. [[John C. Breckinridge]] ordered his men to begin fortifying the crest of Missionary Ridge, a task that Bragg had somehow neglected for weeks. Unable to decide whether to defend the base or the crest of the Ridge, the divisions of Brig. Gens. [[William B. Bate]] and [[J. Patton Anderson]] were ordered to move half of their divisions to the crest, leaving the remainder in the rifle pits along the base. James L. McDonough wrote of the upper entrenchments, &quot;Placed along the physical crest rather than what is termed the [[military crest]] ... these works severely handicapped the defenders.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;McDonough, pp. 124-28, 183; Woodworth, ''Six Armies'', pp. 181, 196-97; Korn, p. 143; Connelly, pp. 270-72; Cozzens, pp. 140-42; O.R. Series I, Vol. XXXI, Part 2, pp. 706-708.&lt;/ref&gt;

November 24 was dark, with low clouds, fog, and drizzling rain. Sherman's force crossed the Tennessee River successfully in the morning then took the set of hills at the north end of Missionary Ridge, although he was surprised to find that a valley separated him from the main part of the ridge. Alerted by Grigsby's cavalry that the enemy had crossed the river in force, Bragg sent Cleburne's division and Wright's brigade to challenge Sherman. After skirmishing with the Confederates, Sherman ordered his men to dig in on the hills he had seized. Cleburne, likewise, dug in around Tunnel Hill.&lt;ref&gt;Woodworth, ''Nothing but Victory'', pp. 468-69; McDonough, 117-24; Liddell Hart, p. 215; Cozzens pp. 148-50.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time, Hooker's command succeeded in the [[Battle of Lookout Mountain]] and prepared to move east toward Bragg's left flank on Missionary Ridge. The divisions of Stevenson and Cheatham retreated behind Chattanooga Creek, burning the bridges behind them.&lt;ref&gt;McDonough, pp. 137-40, 160; Woodworth, ''Six Armies'', pp. 187-88; Korn, pp. 131-36.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the night of November 24, Bragg asked his two corps commanders whether to retreat or to stand and fight. Cleburne, concerned about what Sherman had accomplished, expected Bragg to retreat. Hardee also counseled retreat, but Breckinridge convinced Bragg to fight it out on the strong position of Missionary Ridge. Accordingly, the troops withdrawn from Lookout Mountain were ordered to the right wing to assist in repelling Sherman.&lt;ref&gt;Cozzens, p. 196; McDonough, p. 182; Woodworth, ''Six Armies'', pp. 188-90.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opposing forces==
{{Further2|[[Chattanooga-Ringgold Campaign Confederate order of battle|Confederate order of battle]], [[Chattanooga-Ringgold Campaign Union order of battle|Union order of battle]]}}

Grant's [[Military Division of the Mississippi]] assembled the following forces at Chattanooga:&lt;ref&gt;Eicher, pp. 601-02.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Army of the Tennessee]], commanded by Maj. Gen. William T. Sherman, consisting of the [[XV Corps (Union Army)|XV Corps]] under Maj. Gen. [[Frank P. Blair, Jr.]], and the 2nd Division of the [[XVII Corps (Union Army)|XVII Corps]] under Brig. Gen. [[John E. Smith]].
* The [[Army of the Cumberland]], commanded by Maj. Gen. [[George H. Thomas]], consisting of the [[IV Corps (Union Army)|IV Corps]] under Maj. Gen. [[Gordon Granger]], and the [[XIV Corps (Union Army)|XIV Corps]] under Maj. Gen. [[John M. Palmer (politician)|John M. Palmer]].
* The command of Maj. Gen. [[Joseph Hooker]], consisting of the [[XI Corps (Union Army)|XI Corps]] under Maj. Gen. [[Oliver O. Howard]] and the 2nd Division of the [[XII Corps (Union Army)|XII Corps]] under Brig. Gen. [[John W. Geary]]. (Starting with the Battle of Lookout Mountain, Hooker also commanded divisions detached from the IV and XV Corps.)

Bragg's [[Army of Tennessee]] had the following forces available in Chattanooga:&lt;ref&gt;Eicher, p. 602.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Hardee's Corps, under [[Lieutenant General (CSA)|Lt. Gen.]] [[William J. Hardee]], consisting of the divisions under Brig. Gen. [[John K. Jackson]] (Cheatham's Division), Brig. Gen. [[J. Patton Anderson]] (Hindman's Division), Brig. Gen. [[States Rights Gist]] (Walker's Division), and Maj. Gen. [[Simon Bolivar Buckner, Sr.|Simon B. Buckner]] (detached November 22 to Knoxville).
* Breckinridge's Corps, commanded by Maj. Gen. [[John C. Breckinridge]], consisting of the divisions of Maj. Gens. [[Patrick R. Cleburne]], [[Alexander P. Stewart]], [[Carter L. Stevenson]], and Brig. Gen. [[William B. Bate]] (Breckinridge's Division). During the battle, Cleburne's division operated under Hardee's control.

On November 5, Bragg had seriously weakened his forces by sending Longstreet's Corps, commanded by Lt. Gen. [[James Longstreet]], with the divisions of Maj. Gen. [[Lafayette McLaws]] and Brig. Gen. [[Micah Jenkins]] (Hood's Division), against Maj. Gen. [[Ambrose Burnside]] near [[Knoxville, Tennessee|Knoxville]]. On November 22, Bragg had further weakened his forces by ordering the division of Maj. Gen. [[Simon Bolivar Buckner, Sr.|Simon B. Buckner]] to reinforce Longstreet at Knoxville.&lt;ref&gt;Eicher, p. 602; Cozzens, pp. 104, 125.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Battle==

]]
On November 25, Grant's plan concentrated on the attack by Sherman against Bragg's right flank at Tunnel Hill. He gave a supporting role to Thomas:

{{Quote|I have instructed Sherman to advance as soon as it is light in the morning, and your attack, which will be simultaneous, will be in cooperation. Your command will either carry the rifle pits and ridge directly in front of them or move to the left, as the presence of the enemy may require.&lt;ref&gt;Cozzens, p. 200.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Grant had no particular expectation for Hooker other than to divert Bragg's attention by continued demonstrations on Lookout Mountain. However, Thomas wanted support on his flank and called Hooker to cross the valley and demonstrate against Bragg's left flank directly at the Rossville Gap.&lt;ref&gt;Cozzens, pp. 200-03.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sherman at Tunnel Hill===
In a letter to his brother, Sherman wrote:

{{Quote|The whole philosophy of the battle was that I should get, by a dash, a position on the extremity of the Missionary Ridge from which the enemy would be forced to drive me, or allow his depot at Chickamauga Station to be in danger. I expected Bragg to attack me at daylight, but he did not, and to bring matters to a crisis quickly, for the sake of Burnside in East Tennessee, Grant ordered me to assume the offensive.&lt;ref&gt;Liddell Hart, p. 220.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Sherman had about 16,600 men in the three divisions of Brig. Gens. [[Morgan L. Smith]], [[John E. Smith]], and his foster brother and brother-in-law [[Hugh Ewing]], and three regiments of Col. [[Adolphus Buschbeck]]'s brigade from the XI Corps; Hardee had about 9,000 Confederates in the divisions of Cleburne and Walker with another 4,000 soon to arrive in Stevenson's division. Sherman also had [[Jefferson C. Davis]]'s division guarding his rear; likewise Hardee had [[Benjamin F. Cheatham]]'s division in reserve. However, at dawn, when Sherman initially planned to attack, he was opposed by three small brigades under Cleburne&amp;mdash;about 4,000 men&amp;mdash;and only the Texas brigade of Brig. Gen. James A. Smith was actually positioned on Tunnel Hill. But seemingly unnerved by his incorrect positioning, Sherman delayed well past his orders to attack at dawn. He selected just two brigades from Ewing's division to attack. Brig. Gen. [[John M. Corse]] would approach from the north, Col. John M. Loomis from the northwest, across the open fields between the railroads.&lt;ref name=&quot;Eicher, p p. 145&quot;&gt;Eicher, p. 601; McDonough, p. 145; Korn, pp. 137-38; Cozzens, pp. 204-05.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Sherman ordered Corse's brigade, with a detachment from [[Joseph Andrew Jackson Lightburn|Joseph A.J. Lightburn]]'s brigade, to attack along the narrow length of Tunnel Hill. Col. John M. Loomis's brigade, supported by Bushbeck, would move across the open fields on the west of the ridge while Brig. Gen. [[Giles A. Smith]]'s brigade would move through the valley on the east side of the ridge. The brigades of Brig. Gen. [[Charles L. Matthies]] and Col. [[Green B. Raum]] were held in reserve to follow up any successful attack; the brigades of Cols. [[Joseph R. Cockerill]] and Jesse I. Alexander would hold the heights seized the day before.&lt;ref name=&quot;Eicher, p p. 145&quot;/&gt; 

Corse drove off the Confederate skirmish line and seized some half-built defensive works at the north end of Tunnel Hill. Continuing over the crest of the hill, Corse charged Cleburne's main position but was repulsed.&lt;ref&gt;McDonough, pp. 144-49; Woodworth, ''Nothing But Victory'', pp. 472-73; Korn, pp. 138-39; Cozzens, pp. 207-13; Korn, p. 138.&lt;/ref&gt; After several attempts, Sherman gave up on attacking from Corse's position and the fighting shifted to the west side of the ridge.&lt;ref&gt;Korn, p. 139; Woodworth, ''Nothing But Victory'', p. 474; Korn, p. 139; Woodworth, ''Six Armies'', p. 191; Cozzens, pp. 214-16.&lt;/ref&gt; Loomis had advanced to the railroad in front of the ridge where he skirmished with Walker's division. Bushbeck, followed by Matthies and then Raum were sent up the west slope of Tunnel Hill between Loomis and Corse. Cleburne's salient began to feel the pressure and it came close to breaking. Hardee fed in reinforcements from Stevenson's division, and Cleburne ordered a general counterattack. Charging down the hill at 4 p.m., the Confederates routed Sherman's men, which was too tired and low on ammunition to resist, and captured numerous Federal prisoners.&lt;ref&gt;Korn, p. 140; Woodworth, ''Nothing But Victory'', pp. 475-76; McDonough, pp. 152-56; Cozzens, pp. 223-41.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote box

Sherman's attack came to a halt, a tactical failure in which he lost almost 2,000 casualties&lt;ref&gt;Korn, p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt; but committed only a fraction of his available force in a direct assault on a strong position, rather than attempting to outflank Bragg. Military historian David Eicher called this Sherman's &quot;worst experience as a commander, first miscalculating the terrain and then stumbling through a prolonged, unsuccessful, and needless attack.&quot; On the other hand, Steven E. Woodworth judged that &quot;Cleburne was in fine form today, deftly shifting troops around his hilltop position and skillfully judging when and where to launch limited counterattacks&amp;mdash;often leading them himself.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Eicher, p. 610; Woodworth, ''Six Armies'', pp. 191-92; McDonough, p. 159; Cozzens, p. 241.&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative view has been expressed by [[Basil Liddell Hart|B. H. Liddell Hart]], who contends that Sherman did not commit his entire force because he was expecting Bragg to attack him to dislodge the Union force from a threatening position. He &quot;gave the Confederates several hours in which to attack them and when he saw that they showed no signs of accepting the invitation, he made it more pressing by launching three brigades against their position. But his real desire is unmistakably established by the fact that he kept three brigades to hold his own ridge, with five more in reserve behind.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Liddell Hart, pp. 219-20.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Thomas's assault on the Confederate center===
[[File:Battle of Chattanooga III.png|thumb|''Battle of Chattanooga&amp;mdash;Gen. Thomas' charge near Orchard Knob, November 24, 1863,''&lt;ref&gt;The date in the title of the painting is inaccurate. There was an action advancing to Orchard Knob on November 23 and further action starting from Orchard Knob on November 25 (the Battle of Missionary Ridge), but no action on November 24.&lt;/ref&gt; 1888 lithograph by Kurz and Allison.]]
At around 2:30 p.m., Grant spoke with Brig. Gen. [[Thomas J. Wood]], a classmate of his from [[West Point]]. &quot;General Sherman seems to be having a hard time,&quot; Grant observed. &quot;It seems as if we ought to go help him.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Cozzens, pp. 246-47.&lt;/ref&gt; He decided to send Wood's and Maj. Gen. [[Philip H. Sheridan]]'s divisions against the Confederate rifle pits at the base of the ridge, hoping to concern Bragg and relieve the pressure on Sherman. Grant suggested his idea to Thomas, but personal relations between the two generals were chilly during the campaign&lt;ref&gt;Woodworth, ''Six Armies'', p. 194.&lt;/ref&gt; and Thomas rebuffed Grant's idea&amp;mdash;he had no intention of attacking until he was assured that Hooker was successfully attacking the enemy's flank. Meanwhile, IV Corps commander Maj. Gen. [[Gordon Granger]] was nearby, completely absorbed in the activities of a battery of artillery.&lt;ref&gt;McDonough, pp. 162-64; Catton, ''Grant Takes Command'', p. 79; Woodworth, ''Six Armies'', p. 195; Cozzens, p. 247.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Irritated, Grant asked Thomas to order Granger to &quot;take command of his own corps. And now order your troops to advance and take the enemy's first line of rifle pits.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Woodworth, ''Six Armies'', pp. 194-96; Cozzens, p. 247.&lt;/ref&gt; At 3 p.m. Thomas passed the order to Granger, but incredibly, Granger ignored the order and resumed commanding the battery of artillery. After a further scolding from Grant, Granger finally issued orders to Wood and Sheridan. Messengers also went to Brig. Gens. [[Absalom Baird]] and [[Richard W. Johnson]] of Maj. Gen. [[John M. Palmer (politician)|John M. Palmer]]'s XIV Corps, ordering them to move upon hearing the rapid, successive discharge of six artillery pieces.&lt;ref&gt;Catton, ''Grant Takes Command'', p. 80; Cozzens, pp. 247-48.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Thomas deployed 23,000 men in four divisions with brigades in line&amp;mdash;from left to right (north to south), the divisions of Baird (brigades of Col. [[Edward H. Phelps]], Col. [[Ferdinand Van Derveer]], and Brig. Gen. [[John B. Turchin]]), Wood (brigades of Brig. Gens. [[Samuel Beatty (general)|Samuel Beatty]], [[August Willich]], and [[William B. Hazen]]), Sheridan (brigades of Brig. Gen. [[George D. Wagner]], Col. [[Charles Garrison Harker|Charles G. Harker]], and Col. [[Francis T. Sherman]]), and Johnson (brigades of Col. [[William L. Stoughton]] and Brig. Gen. [[William P. Carlin]]). Each brigade consisted of two lines, one behind the other, with skirmishers leading the way.&lt;ref&gt;Cozzens, pp. 262, 266-67; McDonough, p. 168; Woodworth, ''Six Armies'', p. 196.&lt;/ref&gt;

There were about 14,000 Confederates defending the center of the ridge against which Thomas's men marched, overlapping just slightly the Union approach. From right to left (north to south) were Cheatham's division (brigades of Brig. Gens. [[Edward C. Walthall]], [[John Creed Moore|John C. Moore]], and [[John K. Jackson]]), Hindman's division (commanded by Brig. Gen. [[J. Patton Anderson]], brigades of Brig. Gens. [[Alfred J. Vaughan]], [[Zachariah C. Deas]], and [[Arthur Middleton Manigault|Arthur M. Manigault]]), Breckinridge's division (commanded by Brig. Gen. [[William B. Bate]], brigades of Brig. Gen. [[Joseph H. Lewis (general)|Joseph H. Lewis]], Col. [[R. C. Tyler]], and Brig. Gen. [[Jesse J. Finley]]), and Stewart's division (brigades of Col. [[Randall L. Gibson]], Brig. Gen. [[Otho F. Strahl]], Brig. Gen. [[Marcellus A. Stovall]], and Col. [[James T. Holtzclaw]]).&lt;ref&gt;Cozzens, pp. 262, 266-67; McDonough, pp. 174, 185, 228.&lt;/ref&gt;

| quote  = Grant's order to halt at the rifle pits at the base of the ridge was misunderstood by far too many of the generals charged with executing it. Some doubted the order because they thought it absurd to stop an attack at the instant when the attackers would be most vulnerable to fire from the crest and to a counterattack. Others apparently received garbled versions of the order.

}}
At about 3:40 p.m.,&lt;ref&gt;Woodworth, ''Six Armies'', p. 196; Cozzens, p. 262. 3:40 was the recollection of Granger, although other accounts say as early as 3 p.m. and as late as 4.&lt;/ref&gt; the signal guns fired before Baird could brief Turchin. Some regimental officers claimed to get conflicting orders from the same brigadier. When asked where he was to stop, Willich told one officer, &quot;I don't know, at Hell, I expect.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Cozzens, p. 261.&lt;/ref&gt; Sheridan sent an orderly back to Granger inquiring whether the objective was the base or the top of the ridge, but the signal guns fired before he got an answer. Wagner, Turchin, and Carlin thought they were supposed to carry the ridge top. Most officers were guided only by what the units on either side of them did.&lt;ref&gt;Cozzens, pp. 262, 265, 268; Catton, ''Grant Takes Command'', p. 82; McDonough, pp. 165-66, 168-69, 176-78; Woodworth, ''Six Armies'', pp. 197-98.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The 9,000 Confederates&lt;ref&gt;Woodworth, ''Six Armies'', p. 197.&lt;/ref&gt; holding the rifle pits at the base of the ridge were also plagued by conflicting orders. Some were ordered to fire a volley then retreat, others to hold their ground. Those who stayed to fight were swamped by Union numbers. The Union tide was irresistible, with charging men shouting, &quot;Chickamauga! Chickamauga!&quot;&lt;ref&gt;McDonough, p. 179; Korn, p. 147.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the Confederates were captured while the rest started the 5&amp;ndash;600-foot climb to the ridge top in fear of being shot in the back. Those who escaped were completely winded by the effort and in no shape to defend themselves for several minutes.&lt;ref&gt;Woodworth, ''Six Armies'', pp. 196-97; Cozzens, pp. 268-70.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 100 Confederate cannons&lt;ref&gt;McDonough, pp. 171-72.&lt;/ref&gt; initially hit few of their enemies during the Union rush, but once the Union soldiers stopped at the rifle pits, they began to zero in on them. The Confederate riflemen also poured in their fire. Some Union unit commanders moved their men forward to get out of the worst fire. Willich's skirmishers started up the ridge without orders. Deciding that following them was preferable to being massacred in the rifle pits, Willich gave orders to advance, although several of his units were already doing so. Seeing this, Hazen and Beatty also ordered their first lines up. When Wood reached the rifle pits, the men in the second line begged him to order them up as well. Wood sent them forward.&lt;ref&gt;Cozzens, pp. 270-76; Woodworth, ''Six Armies'', p. 200.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Battle of Chattanooga Thulstrup.jpg|thumb|left|''Battle of Chattanooga'' by [[Thure de Thulstrup]]. Ulysses S. Grant uses a field glass to follow the Union assault on Missionary Ridge. Grant is joined by Generals Gordon Granger (left) and George H. Thomas.]]
Grant was shocked when he saw the Union troops climbing the ridge. He asked first Thomas then Granger who had given the orders. Neither general claimed responsibility, but Granger replied, &quot;When those fellows get started all hell can't stop them.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Cozzens, p. 282.&lt;/ref&gt; Granger then sent a courier to Wood allowing him permission to take the ridge top, if he thought it possible. Several messengers went out at about this time with differing orders, leading to more confusion.&lt;ref&gt;McDonough, p. 167; Eicher, p. 612; Korn, pp. 145-46; Cozzens, pp. 282-83.&lt;/ref&gt;    

On the far left Phelps and Van Derveer captured the rifle pits and held their position. Having negotiated some rough ground, Turchin's brigade lagged behind. But as soon as his men overran the rifle pits, the &quot;Mad Russian&quot; immediately urged his men up the ridge. Before Baird could send his other two brigades, he received an order to halt.&lt;ref&gt;Cozzens, pp. 280-81.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Wagner's and Harker's men started climbing soon after Wood's brigades. Wagner got halfway up before he received an order that he was to stop at the base of the ridge. He ordered his men to pull back. As they did, they suffered heavy losses from the elated Confederate defenders. Wagner's brigade suffered more casualties, around 22%, than any other brigade in the assault.&lt;ref&gt;McDonough, p. 177; Cozzens, pp. 283-84. Hazen's brigade was the second hardest hit and together with Wagner's suffered about 40% of all of the Union casualties assaulting Missionary Ridge (McDonough, p. 194).&lt;/ref&gt; When Wagner and some of Harker's men returned to the rifle pits they saw that Wood's division on their left and units of their own division on the right were still moving uphill. Disgusted that a rival division was getting ahead, Wagner sent his second line up the ridge. Sheridan soon ordered Harker back up also. To their right, Francis Sherman's brigade faced an entrenched line about one-half of the way up the ridge and had hard going. On the far right, Johnson's two brigades faced determined resistance at the rifle pits and were slow in starting up the ridge.&lt;ref&gt;Cozzens, pp. 278-79.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Confederate line first cracked at Bird's Mill Road, at about 5 p.m.&lt;ref&gt;Cozzens, p. 291.&lt;/ref&gt; One of Willich's regiments, joined by two of Hazen's, worked its way within 50 yards of the Confederate breastworks. Protected by a roll of ground, they crept closer, then with a rush they leaped over the works belonging to Col. [[William F. Tucker]]'s brigade. Surprised, the nearest defenders surrendered or fled for their lives. Alertly, the Union field officers swung their regiments to the right and left and began rolling up the Confederate line. Tucker bravely rallied his men, but by this time Willich and Hazen's men were flooding over the breastworks.&lt;ref&gt;Woodworth, ''Six Armies'', p. 200; Cozzens, pp. 294-95.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since Bragg had not provided for a tactical reserve, his defenses were only a thin crust. To seal off the breach, the Southern generals were placed on the horns of a dilemma. When they found Union troops on their flank, they had to pull regiments out of their defense line for a counterattack. This weakened the main line of resistance just as the Union brigades to their front were swarming up to the crest.&lt;ref&gt;McDonough, p. 205; Cozzens, p. 390; Woodworth, ''Six Armies'', pp. 197, 201.&lt;/ref&gt;

Once atop the ridge, Hazen swung his brigade south. The Confederate lines in this direction were held by Brig. Gen. [[Alexander W. Reynolds]]'s brigade, whose men had to endure a hard climb from the base of the ridge. Hit in front and flank, most of Reynolds's tired men melted away. Continuing south, Hazen flanked Col. [[Robert C. Tyler|R. C. Tyler]]'s brigade of Bate's division out of position, allowing Wagner's brigade to reach the crest. Bate's Florida brigade was soon driven away, allowing Harker's men to reach the top. Col. [[Randall L. Gibson]]'s brigade was defeated by Francis Sherman's men. Dogged by tough resistance and very steep slopes, Johnson's two brigades took the longest to climb the ridge, Carlin's men finally reaching the top around 5:30 p.m. Seeing that his position was hopeless, Stewart pulled the brigades of Brig. Gens. [[Otho F. Strahl]] and [[Marcellus A. Stovall]] off the ridge.&lt;ref&gt;Cozzens, pp. 301-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, Willich wheeled to the north and began crushing the flank of Anderson's division. Willich's success assisted Beatty's brigade to get to the top. The two brigades first drove off Brig. Gen. [[Arthur Middleton Manigault|Arthur M. Manigault]]'s men and continued rolling north. As they came up the ridge, the Union brigades of Turchin, Van Derveer, and Phelps (who was killed near the crest) added their weight to the assault against the Confederate brigades of Brig. Gens. [[Zachariah C. Deas]], [[Alfred J. Vaughan]], and [[John K. Jackson]]. Some Confederate soldiers resisted stubbornly, but many panicked and ran when they realized that Union troops were bearing down on them from the flank. Often, the Southern infantry fled before the supporting artillerists could escape with their cannons. In this manner, Anderson's entire division and Cheatham's left flank brigades of Brig. Gens. Jackson and Moore were routed. The northward Federal advance was only stopped by the stout fighting of Walthall's brigade and nightfall. Cheatham, Gist, Stevenson, and Cleburne were able to get their divisions away more or less intact, although the Confederate soldiers were demoralized or chagrined by their defeat.&lt;ref&gt;Cozzens, pp. 320-42.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Army of the Cumberland's ascent of Missionary Ridge was one of the war's most dramatic events. Military historians Herman Hattaway and Archer Jones contend that the Battle of Missionary Ridge was &quot;the war's most notable example of a frontal assault succeeding against intrenched defenders holding high ground.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Hattaway and Jones, p. 461.&lt;/ref&gt; A Union officer remembered that

{{Quote|Little regard to formation was observed. Each battalion assumed a triangular shape, the colors at the apex. ... [a] color-bearer dashes ahead of the line and falls. A comrade grasps the flag. ... He, too, falls. Then another&lt;ref&gt;Smith, p. 280; McDonough, pp. 199-200; Cozzens, p. 308; Woodworth, ''Six Armies'', p. 201. The last flag-bearer mentioned in the quotation, an eighteen-year-old lieutenant, was awarded the [[Medal of Honor]] for this action. He was [[Arthur MacArthur, Jr.]], and would later become the father of [[Douglas MacArthur]].&lt;/ref&gt; picks it up ... waves it defiantly, and as if bearing a charmed life, he advances steadily towards the top ...&lt;ref&gt;Catton, ''American Heritage'', p. 439.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

By 6 p.m., the center of Bragg's line had broken completely and fled in panic, requiring the abandonment of Missionary Ridge and a headlong retreat eastward to South [[Chickamauga Creek]]. The sole exception to the panicked flight was Cleburne's command, his division augmented by two brigades from another division. As the only command not in complete disarray, it was the last unit to withdraw and formed the rearguard of Bragg's army as it retreated eastward. Only Sheridan tried to pursue beyond Missionary Ridge, but he finally gave up late that night when it was clear that he was not being supported by either Granger or Thomas.&lt;ref&gt;Woodworth, ''Six Armies'', p. 202; McDonough, pp. 208-09, 214-15; Cozzens, pp. 343-45, 341-42.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hooker at Rossville Gap===
After Maj. Gen. [[Joseph Hooker]]'s command left Lookout Mountain at about 10 a.m. and moved east, they encountered a significant obstacle. The bridge across Chattanooga Creek, about a mile from Rossville Gap, had been burned by the Confederates as they withdrew the night before and the creek was running high. Brig. Gen. [[Peter J. Osterhaus]] assigned a 70-man [[pioneer (military)|pioneer]] unit to start rebuilding the bridge while men of the 27th Missouri created a rickety footbridge and began crossing one by one. Hooker decided to leave his guns and wagons behind so that all of his infantry could cross first, but his advance was delayed about three hours and he did not reach Rossville Gap until 3:30 p.m.&lt;ref&gt;Woodworth, ''Six Armies'', p. 193; McDonough, pp. 159-60; Korn, p. 142; Cozzens, pp. 244-45.&lt;/ref&gt;

Breckinridge was absent while the Union attack wrecked his corps. Worried about his left flank, he rode to the end of his line in the early afternoon. At 3:30 p.m., about the time Thomas launched his four-division attack on Missionary Ridge, Breckinridge visited Stewart's left flank brigade of Col. [[James T. Holtzclaw]], whose commander pointed to the southwest where Hooker's men were busily bridging Chattanooga Creek. Concerned about Rossville Gap, which lay undefended beyond his left flank, Breckinridge ordered Holtzclaw to send a couple of regiments to hold the position. It was too late; by the time the Southerners reached the gap, the Osterhaus's division had already marched through. Lt. J. Cabell Breckinridge, the general's son and aide-de-camp, rode into a group from the 9th Iowa and was captured.&lt;ref&gt;Cozzens, p. 315; O.R., Series 1, Vol. XXXI, Part 2, p. 615.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Hooker quickly faced his troops to the north and organized a three-pronged attack. He sent Osterhaus along a trail east of Missionary Ridge, Cruft onto the ridge itself, and Geary along the western face of the ridge. Holtzclaw faced his men south and put up a fight, but Cruft and Osterhaus soon began herding the outnumbered Confederates north along Missionary Ridge. Hearing a tremendous racket to the north, Breckinridge finally rode off to find out what was wrong. As Holtzclaw retreated before Hooker's command, he eventually bumped into Col. [[Anson G. McCook]]'s 2nd Ohio of Carlin's brigade, now astride the ridge. Surrounded by superior forces on four sides, approximately 700 of Holtzclaw's men surrendered.&lt;ref&gt;McDonough, pp. 211-12; Woodworth, ''Six Armies'', p. 202; Cozzens, p. 319.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
During the night, Bragg ordered his army to withdraw toward Chickamauga Station on the [[Western &amp; Atlantic Railroad]] (currently the site of [[Chattanooga Metropolitan Airport|Lovell Air Field]]) and the following day began retreating from there toward [[Dalton, Georgia]], in two columns over two routes.&lt;ref&gt;Cozzens, pp. 346-48.&lt;/ref&gt; The pursuit ordered by Grant was effectively thwarted by Cleburne's defense at the [[Battle of Ringgold Gap]].&lt;ref&gt;Woodworth, ''Six Armies'', pp. 204-05; Cozzens, pp. 372-84.&lt;/ref&gt;

Casualties for the Union Army during the Battles for Chattanooga (Orchard Knob, Lookout Mountain, and Missionary Ridge) amounted to 5,824 (753 killed, 4,722 wounded, and 349 missing) of about 56,000 engaged; Confederate casualties were 6,667 (361 killed, 2,160 wounded, and 4,146 missing, mostly prisoners) of about 44,000. Southern losses may have been higher; Grant claimed 6,142 prisoners. In addition, the Union Army seized 40 cannons and 69 limbers and caissons. When a chaplain asked General Thomas whether the dead should be sorted and buried by state, Thomas replied &quot;Mix 'em up. I'm tired of [[States' rights]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Eicher, p. 613.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Confederate enthusiasm that had risen so high after Chickamauga had been dashed at Chattanooga.&lt;ref&gt;Hattaway and Jones, p. 462.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the Confederacy's two major armies was routed. The Union now held undisputed control of the state of Tennessee, including Chattanooga, the &quot;Gateway to the Lower South.&quot; The city became the supply and logistics base for Sherman's 1864 [[Atlanta Campaign]], as well as for the Army of the Cumberland,&lt;ref&gt;The [[Army of the Ohio]] was based in Knoxville, the Army of the Tennessee in Nashville.&lt;/ref&gt; and Grant had won his final battle in the [[Western Theater of the American Civil War|West]] prior to receiving command of all Union armies in March 1864.&lt;ref&gt;Woodworth, ''Six Armies'', p. 213; Cozzens, p. 391; Korn, p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The first inhabitants were the Negritos and &quot;''hatcheros''&quot; (woodcutters) under Don Julián Astigarraga of [[Aparri]]. Some fishermen from Minanga ( a barrio of Gonzaga) came and settled in Palawig. In 1891, Felipe Aragpao with some settlers organized a &quot;''gimong''&quot; (society) called &quot;''Inanama''.&quot; The purpose of the organisation was to acquire and occupy lands around the place. That same year, Briccio Campañano of [[San Juan, Ilocos Sur|Lapog, Ilocos Sur]] together with some others from [[Ilocos]] came to Palawig to apply for homesteads in the sitio of Marede. These settlers organized another &quot;''gimong''&quot; called &quot;''Dagupan''.&quot; 

In 1900, the woodcutters from Aparri led by Don Julian Astigarraga arrived by the first boat. Thus, began the clearing of settlements.

From 1919 to 1935 several group of settlers from the Ilocos Region came to claim lands aboard ''virays'' (light seagoing boats). The once-forested areas were accessible only via rivers and the sea. Before reaching the settlements in the northern and eastern portions, they had to navigate through Palawig River.

The name Palawig was coined from the local term ''pasawig'', meaning mouth of the river. 

In 1935, the gimongs &quot;''Inanama'' and ''Dagupan''&quot; fused into one called &quot;''Da Inanama'',&quot; headed by Navarro, they began to work for the separation of Palawig as a municipality independent from Gonzaga. Their application was held in abeyance because their population did not meet the needed number required by law. The move was suspended in 1941 and unluckily, the [[World War II|war broke out]] and the move was not carried out. 

Barrio Palawig and its neighbouring barrios were separated from [[Gonzaga, Cagayan|Gonzaga]] and the town was created by [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Elpidio Quirino]] via Executive Order No. 289 (21 October 1949). Contrary to the usual assumption, it is not named for [[Saint Anne]] but is an acronym of the surnames of the then-three provincial officials: Governor Nicasio &lt;u&gt;'''A'''&lt;/u&gt;rranz; and Provincial Board members Federico &lt;u&gt;'''N'''&lt;/u&gt;avarro; and Roberto &lt;u&gt;'''A'''&lt;/u&gt;vena. The association to the saint was a back-formation in keeping with traditional Hispanicised [[toponym]]s.

==Economy==
Santa Ana is a mix of agricultural, commercial and agricultural economy. Most of the commercial and industrial activities were at Port Irene as the [[Cagayan Special Economic Zone]].

Some of its agricultural and aquatic products are rice, corn, peanut, fish, lumber, shells, etc. Among its natural resources are limestone deposits at Bawac Mountain, coal at Carbon Mountain, Santa Clara and guano deposit at Kapannikian Cave.

==Tourism==
Aside from the Cagayan Special Economic Zone which host casinos and other gaming facilities, scenic spots and historical landmarks are present in this town. These include:
*Cape Engaño Lighthouse at Punta Verde point
*White beaches like Anguib Beach, Mapurao Beach, Nangaramoan Beach, and Puzo Robo Beach
*Gotan mangrove forest and waterfalls.

Santa Ana is the Game Fishing hub of the Philippines. It has hosted international decathlons, where athletes run through the rugged terrain of Punta Verde to Cape Engaño, then dipped in the crystal clear water of the [[Philippine Sea]].

==Festivities==
Every May 26 to May 30 of the year, the town plays host to the ''Viray Festival'', organized by the local government with the support of the regional tourism office and the private sector. Launched in June 2005, the Viray Festival was conceptualized to dramatize the significance of the viray, which played a key role in the lives and history of the town.

An annual fluvial parade of colorful boats were held during the first day.

A viray is a large wooden flat boat which, before the use of gasoline-fed engines in the early 1950s, was propelled by sails. Comerciantes (traders) used large virays measuring 18 meters long, 5 meters wide and 3.5 meters high.

Fishermen, on the other hand, used smaller ones, usually 11 meters long, 5 meters wide and 2.5 meters high. Equipped with oars to reach nearby fishing grounds, these types sailed for longer distances.

Due to its capacity to carry great quantities of cargo, viray was the only means of transport used by the first settlers of Santa Ana. 

Leaders and well-off families derived income from the services of the viray ranging from fishing operation, commerce and trade to means of transport during the years when Santa Ana was at its prime. Used for daklis (trawl net), sapiao (net) and sirut (ring net) fishing, viray could carry the fishing gears, provisions, supplies, and manpower. It is assisted by small bancas during the fishing operation.

The second day of the festival features a grand carabao parade where each of the 16 barangays composing the municipality had their turn to show off their artistic talents.

On the third day, local folks and visitors alike lined up along the main street to watch colorful bodies participating in the street dancing competition.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2450">'''Cenred of Wessex''' was a member of the [[House of Wessex]] and a member of the direct male line from [[Cynric of Wessex|Cynric]] to [[Egbert of Wessex|Egbert]].  It is possible that Cenred ruled alongside his son [[Ine of Wessex|Ine]] for a period. There is weak evidence for joint kingships, and stronger evidence of subkings reigning under a dominant ruler in Wessex, not long before his time.&lt;ref name=Yorke_145&gt;Yorke, ''Kings and Kingdoms'', p.145&amp;ndash;146&lt;/ref&gt;  Ine acknowledges his father's help in his code of laws,&lt;ref name=Kirby_122&gt;Kirby, ''Earliest English Kings'', p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt; and there is also a surviving land-grant that indicates Cenred was still reigning in Wessex after Ine's accession.&lt;ref name=ASP_S45&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.anglo-saxons.net/hwaet/?do=seek&amp;query=S+1164 | title = Anglo-Saxons.net S 1164 | accessdate=4 July 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kirby_120&gt;Kirby, ''Earliest English Kings'', p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt;

His father was [[Ceolwald of Wessex]]. Cenred had at least two other children: Ingild, the great-grandfather of [[Ealhmund of Kent]], and the great-great grandfather of Egbert; and [[Cuthburga]], who married [[Aldfrith of Northumbria]], and became abbess of [[Wimborne Minster (church)|Wimborne]]. There may also have been another daughter who was married to [[Aethelfrith of Wessex]], but this claim may have been substantiated to further [[Æthelheard of Wessex]]'s claim to the throne.

 |ShortSummary = After losing her virginity to 16-year-old Ricky Underwood at [[band camp]], 15-year-old Amy Juergens discovers that she is pregnant. Scared to tell her parents and unsure what to do, she turns to her two best friends, Lauren and Madison, for help. To confirm the pregnancy they run out and buy her three different pregnancy tests, all of which turn up positive. They encourage her to go to her doctor but not to tell until she is absolutely certain. Meanwhile, in a quest to lose his virginity, Ben Boykewich, sees Amy across the crowded hallway and is encouraged by his best friends, Henry and Alice, to ask her out. He joins the band to meet her and one day asks her to the homecoming dance after the school's big football game. There he becomes completely enamored by her, as does she, however Amy struggles with having to tell him that she's pregnant. Lauren and Madison attempt to convince Amy to have sex with Ben and tell him the baby is his, but she refuses. Ricky comes up to Amy telling her she shouldn't be with Ben. Meanwhile, Jack Pappas, longtime boyfriend to the adherently Christian Grace Bowman, struggles with the idea of having to wait at least ten more years to have sex with Grace. Under pressure he secretly spends the night with Adrian Lee, the school majorette and Ricky's girlfriend. At the dance he begs her not to tell anyone about their night spent together. They kiss and are caught by Tom Bowman, Grace's brother, who alerts Grace (as well as the entire school) to Jack's infidelity. |LineColor = 4682BF

 |ShortSummary = Despite Madison and Lauren's insistence that Amy tell her parents about their pregnancy, Amy insists on convincing herself that Ricky and her pregnancy never happened and tries to go about her life as normal. As they discuss Amy's situation, they are overheard by Henry and Alice in the hallway and the rumor spreads throughout the school that Ricky and Amy had sex. Meanwhile, Ricky attempts to pursue Amy, despite her insistence that she is seeing someone else and is not interested. Despite the new rumor about Ricky and Amy and despite Adrian's kiss with Jack, Adrian and Ricky continue to see each other, however their relationship is wrought with constant bickering. Ben continues to be completely enamored by Amy, even going to far as admitting to Henry and Alice that he can see himself marrying her. They warn him about the rumor they overheard and he begins to fear that he is in competition with Ricky. He tells Amy he heard the rumors but that they mean nothing to him, telling Amy he loves her. During this time, Jack is also pleading with Grace for forgiveness but she refuses to speak to him. At school, she calls her mother and asks to take her home.

Following the [[U.S. Supreme Court]]'s decision in ''[[Boy Scouts of America v. Dale]]'', Knight was interviewed by anchor [[Bryant Gumbel]] on the [[CBS]] morning program ''[[The Early Show]]'' Thinking he was off air after the segment, Gumbel profanely cursed Knight, who has been featured on virtually every major network news or talk show. [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] television cancelled a scheduled appearance of Knight's for ''[[Good Morning America]]'' a few days later at the urging of homosexual activists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Graham|first=Tim|title=Did Gumbel Call Guest a 'F---ing Idiot'?|url=http://www.mrc.org/realitycheck/2000/20000630.asp|work=Reality Check|publisher=Media Research Center|date=2000-06-30|accessdate=2008-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Albert Henry Hanson''' (20 April 1913 &amp;ndash; 27 April 1971) was the first Professor of Politics at the [[University of Leeds]]. 

==Life==
Hanson, who was born in [[Swindon]], was educated at [[Swindon Grammar School]] and [[Jesus College, Oxford]], obtaining a first-class [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] in Modern History in 1934. Whilst at university, he joined the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]], remaining a member until 1953 when he concluded that membership conflicted with his academic independence.  After leaving Oxford and spending some years as a teacher, he joined the army in 1941, serving in the [[Royal Army Ordnance Corps]] and the [[Royal Artillery]].  He reached the rank of major and finished his service as Chief Instructor at the Army School of Education, in [[Maynyo]], [[Burma]]. After two years at the Coopers Hill Emergency Training College, he was appointed as lecturer in Public Administration at the [[University of Leeds]] in 1948.  It was largely through his efforts that politics and public administration became established topics of study at the university.  He was promoted to [[Reader (academic rank)|Reader]] in 1956 and then became Leeds University's first Professor of Politics in 1963.  His particular interests were public administration and [[nationalized industries]], and he became known for his work in these fields in developing countries, particularly India and in Africa, leading to many invitations to teach and lecture abroad.  His works in this field included ''Public Enterprise and Economic Development'' and ''The Process of Planning in India''.  Other areas of study included parliamentary reform and the teaching of political science in universities in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=30 April 1971|page=16|work=[[The Times]]|title= Prof A.

The '''Federal Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information''' (FfDF) is the federal commissioner not only for [[data protection]] but also #since commencement of the [[Freedom of Information Act#Germany|German Freedom of Information Act]] on January 1, 2006# for [[freedom of information]].

Before the commencement of the Act, his title was &quot;Federal Commissioner for Data Protection #FfD#&quot;. In this capacity, according to the German Federal [[Data Protection Act]] #FDPA# [ [[Bundesdatenschutzgesetz]] #BDSG# ], he is an independent control entity providing monitoring for data protection in public federal government positions and at corporations, and telecommunications and postal services. He produces a semiannual activity report. The [[German Federal Government]] nominates him and the [[Deutscher Bundestag|German Bundestag]] elects him. During his time in office, he receives remuneration in the amount commensurate with a federal official in salary group B 9. In this regard, his status is that of a public law official, but not, however, that of a civil servant. The term of office is five years. He can be reelected.

A right to refuse to give evidence is available to the federal commissioner in regard to persons and facts with which comes into contact in his capacity as federal commissioner #FDPA §23, sec. 4#. He is also empowered to decide about his employees' refusal to give evidence.

The [[Federal Ministry of the Interior #Germany#|German Federal Ministry of the Interior]] establishes the federal commissioner. His agency assumes an exceptional administrative organizational position. The FfDI's budget is accounted for in its own chapter. The necessary personnel and facilities are to be made available to him pursuant to legal regulations. Positions at the FfDI can only be filled with his approval.

An '''optical microcavity''' is a structure formed by reflecting faces on the two sides of a spacer layer or optical medium. The name ''micro''cavity stems from the fact that it is often only a few micrometers thick, the spacer layer sometimes even in the nanometer range. As with common [[laser]]s this forms an [[optical cavity]] or ''optical resonator'', allowing a [[standing wave]] to form inside the spacer layer.

The thickness of the spacer layer determines the so-called &quot;cavity-mode&quot;, which is the one [[wavelength]] that can be transmitted and will be formed as standing wave inside the resonator. Depending on the type and quality of the mirrors, a so-called stop-band will form in the transmission [[spectrum]] of the microcavity, a long range of [[wavelength]]s, that is reflected and a single one being transmitted. (usually in the centre)

The fundamental difference between a conventional [[optical cavity]] and microcavities is the effects that arise from the small dimensions of the system. [[Quantum]] effects of the light's [[electromagnetic field]] can be observed. For example, the [[spontaneous emission]] rate and behaviour of [[atom]]s is altered by such a microcavity. One can imagine this as the situation that no [[photon]] is emitted, if the environment is a box that is too small to hold it. This leads to an altered [[emission spectrum]], which is significantly narrowed.

There are different means of fabricating microcavities, either by evaporating alternating layers of dielectric media to form the mirrors ([[Distributed Bragg reflector|DBR]]) and the medium inside the spacer layer or by modification of [[semiconductor]] material or by metal mirrors.

Microcavities have many applications preferably in optoelectronics, where vertical cavity surface emitting lasers [[VCSEL]] are probably the best known. Recently, a single [[photon]] emitting device was demonstrated by placing a [[quantum dot]] in a microcavity. These light sources are interesting for [[Quantum cryptography]] and [[Quantum computer]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7942">'''Atlantic Creole''' is a term used in [[North America]] to describe the Charter Generation of  [[Slavery|slaves]] during the [[European colonization of the Americas]] before 1660. These slaves had cultural roots in [[Africa]], [[Europe]] and sometimes the [[Caribbean]]. They were of [[mixed race]], primarily descended from European fathers and African mothers. Some had lived and worked in Europe or the Caribbean before coming (or being transported) to North America. Examples of such men included [[John Punch (slave)|John Punch]] and [[Emanuel Driggus]] (his surname was possibly derived from [[Rodríguez (surname)|Rodriguez]]).&lt;ref&gt;Ira Berlin, ''Many Thousands Gone: The First Two Centuries of Slavery in North America'', Cambridge, MA: Belknap Press, 1998 Pbk, p.39&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;WNET&quot;&gt;[http://www.wnet.org/pressroom/release.php?get=1471 &quot;Individual Stories- Individual Heroes&quot;], ''Slavery and the Making of America'', WNET, accessed 30 September 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The historian Ira Berlin (1998) identified the arrival of the &quot;Atlantic Creoles&quot; in the [[Chesapeake Bay]] region in the 17th century. He traced the Atlantic creoles to descendants of European sailors and traders as fathers and African mothers. They were born generally in the port cities of the west coast of Africa, where Portuguese traders had been active since the mid-16th century. Growing up in multi-lingual environments, the men, whether enslaved or free, often worked as interpreters or go-betweens for Africans and Europeans; others worked as sailors, merchants and traders. Later some traveled to the Caribbean, North America, or Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Berlin (1998), ''Many Thousands Gone,'' pp. 17-26&lt;/ref&gt; 

Berlin writes that Atlantic creoles were among what he called the Charter Generation of slaves in the [[Chesapeake Colonies|Chesapeake Colony]], up until the end of the seventeenth century. Through the first 50 years of settlement, lines were fluid between black and white workers; often both worked off passage as indentured servants, and any slaves were less set apart than they were later.&lt;ref&gt;Berlin (1998), ''Many Thousands Gone,'' pp. 29-33&lt;/ref&gt; The working class lived together, and many white women and black men developed relationships. Many of the new generation of creoles born in the colonies were the children of European indentured servants and bonded or enslaved workers of primarily West African ancestry (some Native Americans were also enslaved, and some Indian slaves were brought to North America from the Caribbean, Central and South America.&lt;ref&gt;see Forbes (1993).&lt;/ref&gt;). 

According to the principle of ''[[partus sequitur ventrem]],'' incorporated into colonial law in 1662, children born in the colony took the status of the mother; when the mothers were enslaved, the children were born into slavery, regardless of paternity, whether by free Englishmen or enslaved workers. This was a change from English common law, which had asserted that children took the status of the father. Paul Heinegg and other twentieth-century researchers have found that 80% of the [[free people of color]] in the Upper South in colonial times were born to white mothers (thus gaining freedom) and African or African-American fathers.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Heinegg [http://www.freeafricanamericans.com ''Free African Americans of Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Maryland and Delaware'' (2005)], accessed 15 Feb 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frank Sweet [http://backintyme.com/essays/?p=27 &quot;Myths across the Color Line,&quot; BackinTyme Website (2007)], accessed 21 Mar 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Some male African slaves were freed in the early years as well, but free mothers were the source of most of the free families of color.

According to Berlin, some of these mixed-race &quot;Atlantic Creoles&quot; were culturally what today is called  &quot;[[Latino]]&quot; in the [[United States]], as they were descended from Portuguese and Spanish fathers, primarily in the trading ports of West Africa; they had surnames such as [[Chávez (surname)|Chavez]], Rodriguez, and [[Francisco]]. In the Chesapeake Bay Colony, many of the Atlantic Creoles intermarried with their English neighbors, adopted English surnames, became property owners and farmers, and owned slaves in turn. The families became well-established, with numerous free descendants by the time of the [[American Revolution]].

In 2007, Linda Heywood and [[John Thornton (historian)|John Thornton]] used &quot;newly available data from the DuBois Institute and Cambridge University Press on the trade and transportation of slaves&quot; in their new work on the relation of Central Africans to the Atlantic Creoles.  They found strong support for Berlin's thesis of the Charter Generations of slaves, before 1660, coming primarily from West Africa.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brunelle&quot;&gt;[http://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.php?id=31357 Gayle K. Brunelle, &quot;Central West Africans in Diaspora&quot;], History-Net, July 2011, accessed 30 September 2011&lt;/ref&gt; They also noted that in the [[Kingdom of Kongo]] (northern present-day [[Angola]]), the leaders adopted [[Catholicism]] in the late 15th century due to Portuguese influence.  This led to widespread conversion of the people. They formed a type of African-Catholic spirituality unique to the region, and the people frequently adopted Portuguese names in baptism.  The kingdoms were Christian for nearly 400 years and many of their people were taken as slaves by the Portuguese.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thornton&quot;&gt;[http://www.theroot.com/views/forgotten-catholic-kingdom-kongo?page=0,1 John Thornton and Linda Heywood, &quot;A Forgotten African Catholic Kingdom&quot;], 'The Root'', 12 August 2011, accessed 30 September 2011&lt;/ref&gt;  The historians argue that numerous people from Kongo were transported to the North American colonies as slaves, especially to South Carolina and Louisiana.  Kongolese Catholics led the [[Stono Rebellion]] in 1739. They estimate about one in five African Americans are descended from Kongolese ancestors.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thornton&quot;/&gt;  

These slaves, rather than the small mixed-race communities around European trading posts, were the source of most early Atlantic Creoles with Iberian surnames in North America. Many were Christian, were multi-racial and multi-lingual, and familiar with some aspects of European culture.  The Dutch colonies in South America, the Caribbean and New York were also populated by numerous enslaved Atlantic Creoles from the Kingdom of Kongo.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brunelle&quot;/&gt;  

The authors suggest that as the English and Dutch imported more slaves from outside the Atlantic Creole areas to supply the increased labor needs of the Plantation Generation, they found the non-Christian Africans more ethnically and culturally different.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brunelle&quot;/&gt;  Such differences, especially as the slaves were not Christian, made it easier for the English to gradually adopt the concept of [[chattel]] slavery and the colonial equation of Africans with slaves that prevailed through the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. This was the change institutionalized in ''partus'', which made all children of slave mothers born into slavery.&lt;ref&gt;Linda Heywood and John Thornton, ''Central Africans, Atlantic Creoles and the Foundation of the Americas, 1585-1660'' (Cambridge and New York: Cambridge University Press, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; By the late eighteenth century, decades of interaction between white men and enslaved women led to slaves who were primarily of European ancestry. For instance, the slave [[Sally Hemings]] and her siblings at [[Monticello]] were three-quarters white (three of her grandparents were white) and descended from two generations of white fathers. Her children by [[Thomas Jefferson]] were seven-eighths white (or European) in ancestry. The Hemings children were legally &quot;white&quot; under Virginia law of the time but, born to a slave mother, they were slaves.

The '''Aleutian Basin''' is an [[oceanic basin]] under the southwestern [[Bering Sea]].  While the northeastern half of the Bering Sea overlies the [[North American Plate]] in relatively shallow water, the Aleutian Basin consists of oceanic plate&amp;mdash;the remnant of the [[Kula Plate]] that was mostly [[subduction|subducted]] under the North American Plate.&lt;ref name=unh&gt;[http://ccom.unh.edu/publications/Gardner_05_USHydro_New_views_of_US_continental_margins.pdf New Views of the U.S. Continental Margins (University of New Hampshire)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Subduction of the Kula Plate ceased after the creation of the [[Aleutian Trench]] to its south.  What remained of the Kula Plate attached to the North American Plate.  This former subduction zone is now the [[Beringian Margin]], which now hosts sixteen [[submarine canyons]], including [[Zhemchug Canyon]], the world's largest.&lt;ref name=unh/&gt;

The deep-water part of the Bering Sea is separated into the Commander and Bowers basins by the submarine [[Shirshov Ridge]]  and [[Bowers Ridge]]. The [[Commander Basin]] occupies the western part of the Bering Sea, with the Shirshov Ridge on its eastern border. The Shirshov Ridge extends 750&amp;nbsp;km  southward from the Russian [[Olyutorskii Peninsula]] to connect with Bowers Ridge. The Bowers Ridge extends in the form of an arc over approximately 900&amp;nbsp;km from the [[Aleutian Islands]] Arc to the northwestern termination, where it meets Shirshov Ridge. This former [[island arc]], Bowers Ridge, is a prominent semi-circular-shaped geological that meets the Aleutian arc and, together with the Aleutians, bounds [[Bowers Basin]].&lt;ref name=Verz&gt;{{cite journal|last=Verzhbitsky|first=E.

The northern part of the Shirshov Ridge formed 95 My before the present. The ridge grows younger as it goes south, with the southern part of the Shirshov Ridge formed 33 My ago (Early Oligocene). Bowers Ridge was formed 30 My before the present (Late Oligocene).&lt;ref name=Verz/&gt;

[[File:A 65 en construction, au niveau de Auriac vue 3 vers Pau.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Construction in June 2010]]

The '''A65 autoroute''' is motorway in south west [[France]].  Construction started in 2008 and it was officially opened on 14 December 2010.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sudouest.fr/2010/12/15/le-ruban-coupe-l-a-65-va-ouvrir-267672-626.php#xtor=EPR-260-%5BNewsletter%5D-20101215-%5Bzone_info%5D&lt;/ref&gt;  It connects [[Langon, Gironde|Langon]] ([[Gironde]]) to [[Pau, Pyrénées-Atlantiques|Pau]] ([[Pyrénées-Atlantiques]]), with a toll payable of € 19.70 for the complete journey by car.

Known also as ''Autoroute de Gascogne'', its length is approximately 150 km. The construction project has been initiated by CIACT, who announced the beginning of work in 2008. It was built by a joint venture A'LIENOR, 65% owned by Eiffage and 35% by SANEF, who will have effective control for 65 years.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sudouest.fr/2010/12/15/le-ruban-coupe-l-a-65-va-ouvrir-267672-626.php#xtor=EPR-260-%5BNewsletter%5D-20101215-%5Bzone_info%5D&lt;/ref&gt;

The financing, construction and running the motorway was born by the private company with no public subsidy required.  Funds of over one billion euros were needed from the shareholders and banks to finance the road.

==Schedule==
*2006-2007 Decree of [[Déclaration d'utilité publique|declaration of public utility]] (DUP). Final negotiation of the contract with the State, which will be published after the publication of the decree. Detailed studies into the detail and preliminary procedures to complete the work: Investigations and Hydraulics (legal issues on water). 
*2008 land Acquisition and beginning of work 
*Opened December 16, 2010. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.larepubliquedespyrenees.fr/2010/12/07/a65-l-aller-retour-pau-bordeaux-coutera-43-80-euros,169938.php&lt;/ref&gt;

==Layout==
The road increases the speed of journeys from Bordeaux to Pau by automobile. It offers an alternative to the RN134 and RD932 and RD934 (Landes and the Gironde). The road starts in [[Langon, Gironde|Langon]], near [[Bordeaux]], at a junction with [[A62 autoroute|A62]], then crosses the [[Gironde]] and the Eastern part of the [[Landes (department)|Landes]] where it integrates the By-pass round  [[Aire-sur-l'Adour]]. Finally it heads through the northern [[Pyrénées-Atlantiques]] joining the [[A64 autoroute|A64]] at [[Poey-de-Lescar]], near [[Pau, Pyrénées-Atlantiques|Pau]].

==Environmental Impact==
The road consumes 2000 hectares of virgin countryside, in particular sections of France's largest forest, Les Landes.  It was predicted to require 4 million tons of aggregates in its construction.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8202">[[Image:Kannunik College.JPG|thumb|19th Century Flemish Catholic rochet trimmed with old [[bobbin lace]]]]

A '''rochet''' is a white [[vestment]] generally worn by a Roman Catholic or Anglican [[Bishop]] in [[choir dress]]. It is unknown in the Eastern Churches. The rochet is similar to a [[surplice]], except that the sleeves are narrower. In the Roman Catholic tradition, the rochet comes below the knee and its sleeves and hem are sometimes made of lace; in the Anglican tradition, the rochet comes down almost to the hem of the cassock and its sleeves are gathered at the wrist.

The word stems from the Latin ''rochettum'' (from the late Latin ''roccus'', connected with the Old High German ''roch'', ''roc'' and the A.S. ''rocc''; Dutch ''koorhemd, rochet'', French ''rochet'', German ''Rochett, Chorkleid'', Italian ''rocchetto'', Spanish ''roquete''), means an ecclesiastical vestment.

== Catholic Usage ==
In the [[Roman Catholic Church]], [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinals]], Bishops and certain other dignitaries use a rochet, a garment that is worn over the [[choir cassock]] for non-eucharistic functions.

The Catholic rochet is a tunic of white, usually fine [[linen]] or [[muslin]] ([[batiste]], mull) reaching about to the knee, and distinguished from the [[surplice]] mainly by the narrower sleeves which make its arms tight-fitting, and is frequently trimmed with [[lace]]. The lower edge and the sleeves may also be garnished with lace, lined with violet or red silk in the case of prelates, or more rarely with embroidered borders.

The rochet is proper to, and distinctive of, [[prelate]]s and [[bishops]], but the right to wear it is sometimes granted by the [[pope]] to others, especially the canons of cathedral churches. It is not a ''vestis sacra'', and cannot therefore be used as a substitute for the [[surplice]], e.g. in the administering of the Sacraments (Decree of the Congregation of Rites of January 10, 1852). Nonetheless, since it is used at choir services and is ordered to be worn over the everyday dress at Mass (Missa rom. Rit. celebr. i. 2), it may be included among liturgical vestments in the widest sense. It is worn instead of a [[surplice]] by [[Canons Regular]] as part of their habit for liturgical use alone.

The earliest notice of the use of the rochet is found in an inventory of the vestments of the Roman clergy, dating from the 9th century. In this it is called ''camisia'', a name which it retained at Rome until the 14th century, and it seems to have been already at that time proper to particular members of the clergy. Other Roman names for the vestment were ''succa, sucta''; it was not till the 14th century that the name ''rochettum'' appeared at Rome, but it was not long before it had superseded all the native designations.

Outside Rome, too, the vestment is early met with, e.g. in the Frankish empire (9th century) as ''alba clericalis'', in contrast to the liturgical [[alb]], and in England (10th century) under the name of ''oferslip'' in the 46th canon of the ecclesiastical laws of Edgar. At the beginning of the 12th century the rochet is mentioned, under the name of ''camisia'', by Gilbert of Limerick and by Honorius, and, somewhat later, by Gerloh of Reichersperg as ''tunica talaris''. From the 13th century onward it is frequently mentioned. The name ''rocheltum'' is first traceable in England; in Germany and northern France the rochet was also called ''sarohi'' (Latinized ''sarrotus'') or ''sarcos'' (Latinized ''sarcotium'').

[[Image:Sint-Salvatorskapittel Bruges Precious Blood 2008.JPG|thumb|Canons in Bruges]]

Outside Rome the rochet was, until well into the 14th century, a vestment common to all the clergy, and especially to those of the lower orders; and so it remained, in general, until the 16th century, and even, here and there, so late as the 19th. Moreover, in further contrast to the Roman use, it had, especially in the German dioceses, a liturgical character, being used instead of the surplice.

The rochet was originally a robe-like tunic, and was therefore girdled, like the liturgical alb. So as late as 1260 the provincial synod of Cologne decreed that the ''vestis camisialis'' must be long enough entirely to cover the everyday dress. A good example of the camisia of the 12th century is the rochet of Thomas Becket, preserved at Dammartin in the Pas de Calais, the only surviving medieval example remarkable for the pleating which, as was the case with albs also, gave greater breadth and more elaborate folds. In the 15th century the rochet only reached halfway down the shin; in the 16th and 17th to the knee; in the 18th and 19th often only to the middle of the thigh.

In the Middle Ages it was always plain.

== Anglican Use ==

In the [[Anglican Church]] the rochet is a vestment peculiar to bishops, and is worn by them in choir dress, with the [[chimere]], both at all times of their ministration in church and also on ceremonial occasions outside, e.g. sitting in the [[House of Lords]], attending a royal levee, or [[Graduation|commencement]] ceremony. It may be worn with a [[Stole (vestment)|stole]], [[cope]] and [[mitre]] for more dignified occasions (such as [[Baptism]] outside the context of the [[Eucharist]], Solemn [[Evening Prayer (Anglican)|Evensong]], royal weddings and the [[coronation]] of the [[Monarch|Sovereign]]).
[[File:Archbishop of Canterbury visits the Mateer Memorial Church in October 2010.jpg|thumb|Then-Archbisop of Canterbury, Dr Rowan Williams visiting India in 2010; the local Anglican bishops are wearing the more usual gathered sleeves.]]

In general it has retained the medieval form more closely than the Roman rochet and more resembles the [[alb]], insofar as it is of plain, very fine linen, and reaches almost to the feet. The main modifications have been in the (usually) baggy 'lawn' sleeves that are gathered at the wrists with a band of black or scarlet cloth. At the time of the [[English Reformation|Reformation]] these were still narrow, though already showing a tendency to expand. The portrait of [[Archbishop Warham]] at [[Lambeth]], for instance, shows a rochet with fairly wide sleeves narrowing towards the wrists, where they are confined by fur cuffs. This fashion continued until, in the 17th century, the sleeves became much fuller; only in the 18th century did they develop into the familiar exaggerated balloon shape, confined at the wrists by a ribbon, beyond which a ruffle projected. About the same period, too, arose the custom of making the rochet sleeveless and attaching the lawn sleeves to the chimere. This remained the fashion most of the 19th century, but there has since been a tendency to revert to the earlier less exaggerated form, and the sleeves have been reattached to the rochet. The ribbon by which the wrist is confined is red, except when conducting or participating in a formal, public funeral (e.g. of a head of state), when it is black.

The rochet is worn without the chimere under the cope by those bishops who use this vestment. At his [[consecration]] the bishop-elect is, according to the [[rubric]], presented to the consecrating bishops vested in a rochet only; after the [[cheirotonia|laying on of hands]] he retires and puts on the rest of the episcopal habit; i.e. the chimere.
 
One exception to the normal Anglican-style is the rochet worn by the previous [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], [[Rowan Williams]] which has open-ended narrow sleeves in the manner of the Roman rochet.

'''Chieming''' is a [[Municipalities of Germany|municipality]] in the district of [[Traunstein (district)|Traunstein]] in [[Bavaria]], [[Germany]].

== Etymology ==

The name ''Chieming'', ''[[Chiemsee]]'' and the name of the area ''[[Chiemgau]]'' go back to the Old High German personal name ''Chiemo'' (7./8. century). At the end of the 8th century the name ''Chiemgau'' appeared for the first time in documents as ''Chimigaoe'' but it stood at that time for a smaller area around the village of Chieming.

'''David Gareja''' ({{lang-ka|დავითგარეჯის სამონასტრო კომპლექსი, ''Davit'garejis samonastro komplek'si''}}) is a rock-hewn [[Georgian Orthodox and Apostolic Church|Georgian Orthodox]] monastery complex located in the [[Kakheti]] region of Eastern [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], on the half-desert slopes of Mount Gareja, some 60–70&amp;nbsp;km southeast of Georgia's capital [[Tbilisi]]. The complex includes hundreds of cells, churches, chapels, refectories and living quarters hollowed out of the rock face.

Part of the complex is located in the [[Agstafa Rayon|Agstafa]] [[Administrative divisions of Azerbaijan|rayon]] of [[Azerbaijan]] and has become subject to a border dispute between Georgia and Azerbaijan.&lt;ref name=&quot;az-dispute&quot;&gt;{{cite news

==History==
The complex was founded in the 6th century by David (St. David Garejeli), one of the [[Thirteen Assyrian Fathers|thirteen Assyrian monks]] who arrived in the country at the same time. His disciples Dodo and Luciane expanded the original [[lavra]] and founded two other monasteries known as Dodo's Rka (literally, &quot;the horn of Dodo&quot;) and Natlismtsemeli (&quot;[[John the Baptist|the Baptist]]&quot;). The monastery saw further development under the guidance of the 9th-century Georgian saint Ilarion. The convent was particularly patronized by the Georgian royal and noble families. The 12th-century Georgian king [[Demetre I]], the author of the famous Georgian hymn ''[[Thou Art a Vineyard]]'', even chose David Gareja as a place of his confinement after he abdicated the throne.
[[File:Fresco in David Gareja.jpg|thumb|left|250px|One of the monastery's surviving [[fresco]]es.]]
Despite the harsh environment, the monastery remained an important centre of religious and cultural activity for many centuries; at certain periods the monasteries owned extensive agricultural lands and many villages.&lt;ref&gt;Turner, Jane (ed., 1996), ''The Dictionary of Art'', p. 567. Grove, ISBN 1-884446-00-0.&lt;/ref&gt; The renaissance of fresco painting chronologically coincides with the general development of the life in the David Gareja monasteries. The high artistic skill of David Gareja frescoes made them an indispensable part of world treasure. From the late 11th to the early 13th century, the economic and cultural development of David Gareja reached its highest phase, reflecting the general prosperity of the medieval [[Kingdom of Georgia]]. New monasteries Udabno, Bertubani and Chichkhituri were built, the old ones were enlarged and re-organized.

With the downfall of the Georgian monarchy, the monastery suffered a lengthy period of decline and devastation by the [[Mongol Empire|Mongol]] army (1265), but was later restored by the Georgian kings. It survived the [[Persian Empire|Persian]] attack of 1615, when the monks were massacred and the monastery's unique manuscripts and important works of Georgian art destroyed, to be resurrected under Onopre Machutadze, who was appointed Father Superior of David Gareja in 1690.

After the violent [[Bolshevik]] takeover of Georgia in 1921, the monastery was closed down and remained uninhabited. In the years of the [[Soviet War in Afghanistan]], the monastery's territory was used as a training ground for the Soviet military that inflicted damage to the unique cycle of murals in the monastery. In 1987, a group of Georgian students led by the young writer [[Dato Turashvili]] launched a series of protests. Although, the Soviet defense ministry officials finally agreed to move a military firing range from the monastery, the shelling was resumed in October 1988, giving rise to generalized public outrage. After some 10,000 Georgians demonstrated in the streets of Tbilisi and a group of students launched a hunger strike at the monastery, the army base was finally removed.&lt;ref&gt;Mark R. Beissinger (2002), ''Nationalist Mobilization and the Collapse of the Soviet State'', p. 180. [[Cambridge University Press]], ISBN 0-521-00148-X&lt;/ref&gt;

After the restoration of Georgia's independence in 1991, the monastery life in David Gareja was revived. However, in 1996, the Georgian defense ministry resumed military exercises in the area, leading to renewed public protests. In May 1997, hundreds of Georgian NGO activists set up their tents in the middle of the army's firing range and blocked the military maneuvers. The army officials finally bowed to the public pressure and the exercises were banned.&lt;ref&gt;William Ascher (2000), ''The Caspian Sea: A Quest for Environmental Security'', pp. 207–8. Springer, ISBN 0-7923-6218-7&lt;/ref&gt;

The monastery remains active today and serves as a popular destination of tourism and pilgrimage.

==Georgia–Azerbaijan border dispute==
Because the complex is partially located on the territory of Azerbaijan, it has become subject to a border dispute between Georgian and Azerbaijan, with ongoing talks since 1991.&lt;ref name=&quot;az-dispute2&quot;&gt;{{cite news

In April 2007, Khalafov told a press conference in that it was &quot;out of the question&quot; for Azerbaijan to &quot;give up its claims to the borderlands&quot; including David Gareja.&lt;ref name=&quot;az-dispute&quot; /&gt;  He then made a controversial statement that the monastery &quot;was home to the [[Caucasian Albania]]ns, who are believed to have been the earliest inhabitants of Azerbaijan.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;az-dispute4&quot;&gt;{{cite news

  | accessdate = 2007-06-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This prompted a response from Georgian foreign minister [[Gela Bezhuashvili]]. &quot;It is absolutely unclear to me why my colleague made these remarks,&quot; he told reporters in [[Tbilisi]]. &quot;His history lessons are absolutely incomprehensible. He should read up on world history.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;az-dispute2&quot; /&gt;

The Albanian theory is also supported by some Azerbaijani historians who are strongly opposed to transferring any part of their territory to Georgia.&lt;ref name=&quot;az-dispute4&quot;/&gt; &quot;The monastery was inside Georgia only in the 12th century,&quot; stated Ismail Umudlu, an Azerbaijani journalist and historian. &quot;Both before and after this period, the area was part of a state to which Azerbaijan is a successor.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;az-dispute3&quot;/&gt; Georgian art historian Dimitri Tumanishvili dismissed this claim and stated that the complex &quot;is covered in the work of Georgian masters.&quot;  &quot;There are Georgian inscriptions everywhere dating back to the sixth century,&quot; he said &quot;There are no traces of another culture there. After that, I don’t think you need any further proof.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;az-dispute3&quot;/&gt; &quot;The idea that this monastery was founded by the Caucasus Albanians is simply absurd,&quot; said Zaza Datunashvili, a monk from David Gareja. &quot;You might as well say that Georgians built the [[Great Wall of China]].&quot;

Georgian President [[Mikheil Saakashvili]] downplayed the dispute and said that &quot;it can be resolved through friendly dialogue.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;az-dispute2&quot; /&gt;  However, Giga Bukia, a member of the Georgian parliament with the [[Rightist Opposition]] stated that &quot;Georgians will never, under any circumstances, give up this territory&quot; and also accused the government of softening its position on the complex in order to secure financial aid from Azerbaijan.&lt;ref name=&quot;az-dispute2&quot;/&gt; &quot;Azerbaijan has absolutely no historical rights to this land,&quot; he said. &quot;And what is this talk of it being a strategic location? Are they planning to go to war with Georgia?&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;az-dispute2&quot;/&gt;

Azeri officials confirmed that Azerbaijan &quot;is open to implementation of joint projects with Georgia for the restoration of the complex.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;az-dispute&quot;/&gt; However, official suggestions that the complex could be a &quot;shared tourist zone&quot; have sparked indignation from the Georgian public. [[Catholicos-Patriarch of All Georgia]] [[Ilia II]] said that &quot;the monastery was a holy shrine that should lie entirely on Georgian soil.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;az-dispute2&quot; /&gt; A number of fresh rounds of &quot;[[boundary delimitation|border delimitation]]&quot; talks have been conducted between Azeri and Georgian authorities (in Tbilisi and then in [[Baku]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;az-dispute&quot; /&gt;

The program enabled 36 families to modify their mortgage, avoid going into foreclosure and losing their homes.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.stamfordadvocate.com/default/article/Together-we-can-accomplish-anything-1005879.php &quot;Together we can accomplish anything&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; Meek created the not-for-profit [[START Now!]] in May 2009.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stamfordadvocate.com/news/article/Goldman-Sachs-exec-brings-foreclosure-counseling-1253022.php &quot;Goldman Sachs' exec brings foreclosure counseling show to Bridgeport&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; 

In July 2009, Meek received a request asking for help in obtaining hygienic items for our American soldiers fighting in [[Afghanistan]]. This led him to create the not-for-profit [[Soldier socks]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.connecticutplus.com/cplus/information/news/Local_2/Stamford-resident-launches-non-profit-organization-to-aide-troops-serving-abroad63176317.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stamfordplus.com/stm/information/nws1/publish/News_1/Fedele-to-help-local-group-pack-items-for-troops6816.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Agu Casmir''' (born 23 March 1984 in [[Lagos]], [[Nigeria]]), is a professional soccer player who plays for the [[Singapore LIONSXII]] in the [[Malaysian Super League]] and the [[Singapore national football team]].

He took up [[Singapore citizenship]] in 2004.

In May 2008, rumors surfaced that an Indonesian club was interested in signing him. This comes 2 years after the controversial ''move'' to [[Persija Jakarta]]. But however, he signed for [[Malaysia]]n Super-League side, [[PDRM FA]]. But just after 3 games, he was released, and Gombak United re-signed him.

==Club career==
He has previously played for S.League clubs [[Young Lions (Singapore football team)|Young Lions]] and [[Woodlands Wellington FC]] in Singapore's [[S.League]],

Agu burst onto the football scene with [[Woodlands Wellington FC]] in 2002, scoring a remarkable 27 goals as an 18 years-old. He followed that up with another 15 goals the next year. In 2004 and 2005, playing for [[Young Lions (Singapore football team)|Young Lions]], he scored a total of 31 goals. He returned to [[Woodlands Wellington FC]] last year and scored 17 times, before joining [[Gombak United FC]] at the start of the current 2007 [[S.League]] season.

On September 19, 2007, Agu Casmir's 86th minute goal for the [[Gombak United FC]], which cancelled out [[Home United FC]] [[Kone Hamed]]'s 18th-minute opener, was his 100th in the [[S.League]].

At the end of the 2007, Gombak United decided not to renew his contract and thus. Nevertheless, when the [[FIFA World Cup 2010]] qualifier game against [[Lebanon national football team|Lebanon]] loomed, he trained with one of his former club, [[Young Lions (Singapore football team)|Young Lions]] to keep his fitness at peak condition in order to be eligible for a call up to the national team.

He didn't play for the large part of 2008 due to being clubless, but in August 2008, Malaysian club [[PDRM FA]] signed him together with [[Noh Alam Shah]]. But controversially, he was released after just 3 games, without any goals to his name. Gombak United again came to re-sign him in 2009.

Agu spent the 2011 season playing for [[Persija Jakarta]] in the [[Indonesian Super League]]. On 5 December 2011, it was announced that he would be joining the [[Singapore LIONSXII]] team that would be returning to the [[Malaysian Super League]] for the 2012 season.

==International career==
He was a member of the [[Singapore national football team|Singapore national team]], which won the [[Tiger Cup]] regional football championship in 2005.

He was part of the 2005 and 2007 [[SEA Games]] squad, the latter being a bronze-medal winning team.

His impressive displays in the tail-end of 2008 earned him a national call up for the [[2008 AFF Suzuki Cup|2008 Suzuki Cup]].

He scored a last minute goal for Singapore against Myanmar to allow Singapore to promote to the next round of 2010 Suzuki Cup.

==Controversy==

Controversy arose over Agu Casmir when local press in Singapore reported his absence in January 2006. It was reported that Casmir signed a contract with Indonesian football club [[Persija Jakarta]] and that he took a signing-on fee of US$20,000. However, he did not report for training, claiming to be attending football trials with a Russian club and the club subsequently sought repayment of the fee from his agent, ex-footballer [[Jules Onana]].

It was consequently reported on the 19 February 2006 in [[The Straits Times]] that Agu Casmir had purportedly been in Canada and had no intention of further pursuing a career in football. The report quoted Agu Casmir's ex-manager, [[R. Vengadasalam]], as saying that Casmir was disillusioned with football and had no intention of returning to Singapore. He had taken the contract to prove that he could still command a large annual fee (reported at US$80,000).

After a few weeks, reports emerged that he wanted to return to playing football in Singapore. Several football clubs including [[Gombak United FC]] had expressed interest in inviting him to play for their team, before he re-signed for former club [[Woodlands Wellington FC]] on a one-year contract, under a deal in which the club would re-pay [[Persija Jakarta]] his signing-on fee.

The [[Football Association of Singapore]] suspended him from the national squad for a year and fined him S$20,000, for his actions involving [[Persija Jakarta]].[http://youth.sg/index.php?Itemid=37&amp;id=163&amp;option=com_content&amp;sidenavpos=25&amp;task=view][http://singaporelifetimes.blogspot.com/2006_03_05_archive.html]

They went on to take nine consecutive World Rally Championship titles between 2004 and 2012.

Loeb and Elena have won Elena's home rally, the famous [[Monte Carlo rally]] six times (2003–2005, 2007–2008 and 2012).

Elena is the first person to receive the [[Michael Park (co-driver)|Michael Park]] trophy, which is given yearly to the best co-driver.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3220">'''Charlotte FitzRoy''' or '''FitzCharles''' (Charlotte Jemima Henrietta Maria; {{circa|1650}} – 28 July 1684) was one of the many acknowledged [[Legitimacy (law)|illegitimate]] children of [[Charles II of England]]. Her mother, [[Elizabeth Killigrew, Viscountess Shannon|Elizabeth Killigrew Boyle]],&lt;ref&gt;p.239, [[David Hilliam]], ''Monarchs, Murders and Mistresses''&lt;/ref&gt; wife of [[Francis Boyle, 1st Viscount Shannon|Francis Boyle]] (afterwards [[Viscount Shannon]] in Ireland), had been a [[maid of honour]] to Charles II's mother, [[Henrietta Maria of France|Queen Henrietta Maria]].

Charlotte Jemima Henrietta Maria Boyle, alias FitzRoy, married firstly [[James Howard (dramatist)|James Howard]], with whom she had a daughter. In 1672 she married [[William Paston, 2nd Earl of Yarmouth|William Paston]], later the second [[Earl of Yarmouth]] — a member of the [[Paston Letters|Paston family]] — and had [[Issue (legal)|issue]]. Both William and [[Robert Paston, 1st Earl of Yarmouth|his father]] were in high favour with the Stuarts.

Lady Yarmouth died on 28 July 1684 in [[London]]. She was buried at [[Westminster Abbey]] on 4 August 1684.

==Children==
With her first husband, [[James Howard (dramatist)|James Howard]] (d. 1669), Lady Charlotte had a daughter:
* '''Stuarta''' [[Werburgh|Werburge]] [[Howard family|Howard]] (d. 1706), died unmarried
** Stuarta was a lady-in-waiting to [[Mary II of England|Queen Mary II]]. She was nearly married to the [[William Bentinck, 1st Earl of Portland|1st Earl of Portland]], but their engagement was abandoned. This resulted in a duel between Lord Portland and her stepfather, Yarmouth.

Charlotte had at least four more children by her second husband, [[William Paston, 2nd Earl of Yarmouth]]:
* Lord '''Charles''' Paston (29 May 1673 – 15 December 1718), of [[Oxnead]] Hall, [[Norfolk]]

'''Dura al-Qar'''' ({{lang-ar|'''دورا القرع'''}}) or '''Dura al-Qari'a''' is a [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] town in the central [[West Bank]], part of the [[Ramallah and al-Bireh Governorate]], located four kilometers north of [[Ramallah]]. According to the [[Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics]], Dura al-Qar' had a population of 2,897 inhabitants in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pcbs.gov.ps/Portals/_PCBS/Downloads/book1487.pdf 2007 PCBS Census]. [[Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics]]. p.114.&lt;/ref&gt;

The town's total land area is 4,016 [[dunam]]s, of which 2,891 dunams have been appropriated by [[Israel]] mostly for the purpose of building a by-pass road. According to Dura al-Qar's village council, 142 families have been directly affected by the confiscations and 58% of the town's population depend on those lands as main sources of income.{{Citation needed|reason=Aug. 2010|date=August 2010}} Nearby towns include [[Jifna]] to the north, [[Ein Yabrud]] to the east, [[Beitin]] and [[Beit El]] to the south, and [[Yabrud]] to the north-east.

Dura al-Qar's archaeological history dates back to the [[Roman Empire]], due to excavations of Roman pools, canals and burial tombs. Several restorations have been carried out to protect these sites as conservation areas. The village has a traditional irrigation system and receives water from seven springs and eight irrigation pools.

On August 14, 1995, a Kheir Abdel Hafid Qassem, a 24-year-old Palestinian man was shot dead by an [[Israeli settler]], and many of peoplehave arrested, while he and about a 100 other residents of Dura al-Qar' were attempting to drive away settlers by tearing down Israeli canvas shelters and cinder-block buildings outside of the village.&lt;ref&gt;[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE2D7153FF937A2575BC0A963958260  Settlers' Gunfire Kills Palestinian at West Bank Protest] Greenberg, Joel.

'''John O'Neil Farrell''' (28 August 1906 &amp;ndash; 20 June 1994) was an [[United States|American]] [[Speed skating|speed skater]] and speed skating coach.

John Farrell participated in the [[1928 Winter Olympics]] of [[St. Moritz]]. On the 500&amp;nbsp;m, he skated in the first pair and promptly set a new Olympic record with a time of 43.6 seconds, breaking [[Charles Jewtraw]]'s old record of 44.0 seconds. The record would not stand, though, because in the next pair, [[Clas Thunberg]] skated 43.4 seconds, and in the eighth pair, [[Bernt Evensen]] also skated 43.4. But since nobody else besides those two skated faster than 43.6, Farrell won the bronze medal.

At the [[1932 Winter Olympics]] of [[Lake Placid, New York|Lake Placid]], the speed skating events were skated in ''packstyle'' format (having all competitors skate at the same time) for the only time in Olympic history. Farrell qualified for the final in his heat, but he finished in sixth (and last) place in the final. Two weeks later, he finished fourteenth at the 1932 [[World Allround Speed Skating Championships|World Allround Championships]], also in Lake Placid. At the [[1936 Winter Olympics]] of [[Garmisch-Partenkirchen]], Farrell was coach of the United States speed skating team.

Farrell also was a National Outdoor Champion. He was inducted in the ''National Speedskating Hall of Fame'' in 1971.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9247">[[Image:Mordecai benet portrait.jpg|thumb|200px|Portrait of '''Mordecai Benet''', from the 1906 Jewish Encyclopedia]]

'''Mordecai ben Abraham Benet''' ({{lang-he|מרדכי בן אברהם בנט}}, also '''Marcus Benedict'''; 1753–1829) was a [[Talmudist]] and chief rabbi of [[Moravia]] born at [[Csurgó]], a small village in the county of [[Stuhlweissenburg]], [[Hungary]].

==A gifted child==
As Benet's parents were very poor and consequently unable to engage a teacher, they sent their son when only 5 years old to his grandmother at [[Mikulov|Nikolsburg]]. There [[Gabriel Markbreiter]] provided for the tuition of the gifted child for a period of 6 years, and then sent him to [[Ettingen]], [[Alsace]], the rabbi of which place was Markbreiter's brother-in-law. The latter became Benet's teacher, and took great delight in his pupil's wonderful development. At Benet's [[barmitzva]] (religious majority) celebration his teacher showed the guests, to their great astonishment, three of the boy's manuscripts—a commentary on the [[Pentateuch]], a commentary on the [[Passover Haggadah]], and novellæ on the [[Talmud]].

From his thirteenth to his 15 year Benet devoted himself exclusively to the study of the [[Bible]], with the aid of the Jewish commentaries and of the [[Aggada|Haggadah]] in Talmud and [[Midrash]]; his strictly [[halakhic]] studies he completed later in the [[yeshiva]] of Rabbi [[Joseph Steinhardt]] at [[Fürth]], where he remained three years. He then went as a ''&quot;[[ḥaber]]&quot;'' (senior student) to [[Prague]], where [[Meïr Karpeles]] started a private ''&quot;[[kloyz|klaus]]&quot;'' for him; though [[Ezekiel Landau]] (Noda bihudah) conducted a large [[yeshiva]] in the same city, a number of able Talmudists came daily to hear Benet's discourses. After staying at Prague 2 years he married [[Sarah Finkel]] (died 1828), the daughter of a prominent well-to-do citizen of Nikolsburg. Here he settled in 1773, and within a year was made [[ab bet din]] (ecclesiastical assessor).

Thirteen years later he accepted the rabbinate at [[Lundenburg]] in [[Moravia]], which he held for six months, when he resigned to become rabbi at [[Šaštín-Stráže|Schossberg]], [[Hungary]]. His stay in his native country was short, and in 1789 he was appointed rabbi of Nikolsburg and [[Chief Rabbi]] of Moravia. Later on he received offers also from [[Bratislava|Pressburg]] and [[Kraków]], but yielding to the solicitations of his congregation, he remained at Nikolsburg. Overstudy, however, had brought on a nervous affection in his youth, which clung to him throughout life, and was the cause of his death, which, took place at [[Karlovy Vary|Carlsbad]] on Aug. 12, 1829, where he had gone for treatment. His body was buried temporarily at [[Lichtenstadt]], near Carlsbad, but seven months later was permanently interred at Nikolsburg in accordance with his will.

His friend the famed ''[[Moses Sofer|Chasam Sofer]]'' who had the highest esteem for him; eulogized him and called him ''&quot;ben yochid leKidsho Berich Hie&quot;'' (an only child to [[Hashem]]); meaning that no one was his equal.

==His works==
Although Benet's works are neither numerous nor exhaustive, they are among the classic products of Talmudic literature in the 18th century. They are:
* ''Biur Mordecai'' (The Commentary of Mordecai), Vienna, 1813, a commentary on [[Mordecai ben Hillel]]'s compendium
* ''Magen Abot'' (Shield of the Fathers), Zolkiev, 1835, a treatise on the thirty-nine acts prohibited on the Sabbath
* ''Har ha-Mor'' (Mountain of Myrrh), responsa, with allusion to the rabbinical explanation of the name &quot;Mordecai&quot; by &quot;Mara dakya&quot; (= pure myrrh)
* ''Parashat Mordecai'' (The Explanations of Mordecai), Szigeth, 1889, responsa
* ''Tekelet Mordecai'' (Mordecai's Purple Garment), Lemberg, 1892, [[halakic]] and [[aggada|haggadic]] discourses

All these works clearly show Benet's keenness, wide knowledge of rabbinical literature, and, what is still more important, his logical and strictly scientific method. In contrast to his friends [[Moses Sofer]] and [[Akiba Eiger]], who were [[casuists]], Benet avoided casuistry in discussing involved halakic questions, gaining his ends by means of a purely critical explanation and a systematic arrangement of the matter. An excellent example of Benet's criticism is his letter to the chief rabbi of Berlin, [[Hirschel Levin|Tzvi Hirsch Levin]], whom he tries to convince of the spuriousness of the collection of responsa ''Besamim Rosh.'' This collection was published by [[Saul Berlin]], Levin's son, as the work of [[Asher ben Jehiel]] (''Parashat Mordecai,'' No. 5; ''Literaturblatt des Orients,'' v. 53, 55, 140). A comparison of Benet's criticism on the work with [[Zunz]]'s remarks on it(''Ritus,'' pp.&amp;nbsp;226–228) can not fail to excite admiration of Benet's method.

==Superiority of his style==
Benet's works differ in other respects from those of his contemporaries. His style is clear and elegant, and his language is a pure [[Hebrew]]. Moreover, Benet's attitude toward the strict orthodoxy of his friends and colleagues was exceptional, and may be attributed to his knowledge of modern thought (compare his letter to [[Hirschel Levin|Ẓebi Hirsch Levin]] in ''Literaturblatt des Orients,'' v. 54). These characteristics gave him an independent position in the struggle between orthodoxy and the so-called &quot;spirit of enlightenment.&quot;

==Views on education==
Frequently Benet showed an insight lacking in his opponents. In his memorial to the government on the education of rabbis (printed in ''Toledot Mordecai,'' pp.&amp;nbsp;35–37), he remarked that if the course of studies which the gymnasium demanded of candidates for all other professions were required of a rabbinical candidate, the latter would be fit for anything except the rabbinate. Still, far from objecting to a secular education for rabbis, as he was understood to do (see Löw, ''Gesammelte Schriften,'' ii. 190 et seq.), he favored it; but he thought that a rabbi should first of all possess sufficient knowledge of rabbinical matters; and he proposed that a rabbinical candidate should devote his time chiefly to Jewish subjects until his eighteenth year. His opinions concerning the duties of a rabbi, especially in regard to the instruction of children, show the strong influence that modern views had upon him. He wrote a catechism for religious instruction and submitted it in manuscript to the government. To judge from the letter accompanying it, Benet's views on the education of the young were sensible and in accordance with the spirit of the time.

==Opposes religious reform==
Nevertheless, Benet, conscientiously opposing the new tendency, declared every reform in religious observance to be wrong and harmful. Thus, in a letter to the government concerning the introduction of German into divine service (ib. pp.&amp;nbsp;38–42), he wrote in favor of the preservation of Hebrew. His attitude is significant in view of the fact that, many years later, [[Zacharias Frankel]] used the same arguments in the convention of rabbis at [[Frankfort-on-the-Main]], 1845; and events have proved the truth of the prophecy made by Benet, that if the prayers are said in another language few Jews will care to study Hebrew, and familiarity with the Hebrew Scripture will gradually cease.

Although Benet was independent in his attitude, his learning and high character gained for him many faithful friends among young and old. Even the [[Ḥasidim]] respected him, and [[Dovber Schneuri]], the &quot;middle rabbi&quot; of [[Chabad]], speaks highly of him in a letter (as of 1906) in the possession of [[J. L. Sossnitz]] of New York. Compare also [[Weiss]], ''Zikronotai,'' pp.&amp;nbsp;77–81.

The communities of [[Lichtenstadt]] and [[Mikulov|Nikolsburg]] contended for the honor of interring his mortal remains, and the dispute which later arose over the exhumation of the body was fought with the weapons of learning, and figures in the responsa literature of the time.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="908">'''''You Wrote It, You Watch It''''' is a short-lived [[MTV]] [[sketch comedy]] series starring members of [[The State (TV series)|The State]] comedy troupe before they were given their own show by the network. It was hosted by [[Jon Stewart]], future host of [[The Daily Show]]. 

The comedians performed humorous sketch recreations of letters sent to the MTV offices by viewers, depicting outrageous stories and events from their daily lives, with introductions by Stewart.

An early example of [[crowdsourcing]], the show only lasted one season, premiering in [[1992 in television|1992]] and being canceled in [[1993 in television|1993]]. Jon Stewart would later quip, &quot;You wrote it, you just didn't watch it!&quot;

'''Jessore Sloth Bear Sanctuary''' is situated in the [[Banaskantha district]] in the [[States of India|Indian state of Gujarat]] at the [[Gujarat]]-[[Rajasthan]] border. It was declared as a sanctuary in May 1978, covering an area of about {{convert|180|km2|mi2}}, principally for protection of the [[sloth bear]], which is now categorized as &quot;Vulnerable A2cd+4cd;C1 ver 3.1&quot; as per IUCN red list. Their numbers is declining in the wild and are threatened with extinction.&lt;ref name=Negi&gt;{{Cite book|last=Negi|first= Sharad Singh|title= Handbook of national parks, sanctuaries, and biosphere reserves in India|page=86|accessdate=2010-02-14|url=

The name &quot;sloth&quot; is said to be the epithet travellers and hunters in India gave to the bear when they saw it hanging upside down from branches of trees and consequently they identified it with [[sloth]], an animal that hangs upside down. While it is now known as Sloth Bear, initially it was called 'Bear Sloth' since the game hunters identified this species with the [[Sloth]] of [[South America]] as the physical characteristics and “arboreal” habits of both species matched. Towards the later part of the 18th Century, its scientific name was ''Ursine bradypus'' or ''Ursiform Sloth'' or ''Bradypus ursinus''. But when in early 19th Century, the Sloth Bear, housed in a zoo in [[France]], was examined, scientists identified it correctly as a bear species and thereafter the name was changed from 'Bear Sloth' to &quot;Sloth Bear&quot;.&lt;ref name= Haywood/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gujarat/&gt;&lt;ref name=sloth&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iar.org.uk/media/downloads/iar-sloth-bears.pdf|title= The Sloth Bear |pages=1–23|accessdate=2010-02-16|publisher=Bear Specialist Group|format=pdf}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jessore hill, which is the back drop to the sanctuary, is also prefixed to form the full name &quot;Jessore Sloth Bear Sanctuary&quot;.&lt;ref name= Haywood/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gujarat/&gt;
 
Ministry of Environment and Forests of the [[Government of India]], Forest Department of Gujarat, well known Institutes and Universities of the country, stakeholders and local communities in and around the project area have been engaged in Conservation and Sustainable Management of Dryland Biodiversity of North Gujarat under a [[Global Environment Facility|GEF]]/[[UNDP]] supported project with the objective of conservation of globally significant biodiversity. The two projects identified under the programme, as demonstration project sites were the Jessore and Balaram-Ambaji Sanctuaries. The information gathered under this project in respect of the Jessore Sloth Bear Sanctuary has enhanced the information base and is expected to help in building local establishments to adopt novel ideas to resolve the threats faced by the sanctuary.&lt;ref name=diversity&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.maharashtra.gov.in/english/signs/info_honeybee/HB11(2).pdf|format=pdf|format=pdf|title=Honey Bee Volume 11 (2) April–June 2000|work=Dry Land Biodiversity: Conservation of Dryland Bio Diversity –An indigenous knowledge based study|pages=14–16|accessdate=2010-02-15|publisher=Government t of Maharashtra}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
The sanctuary is located in the Jessore hills of [[Aravalli hills]], to the north of the [[Thar desert]]. It was declared a sanctuary covering an area of {{convert|180.66|km2|mi2}} in 1978.&lt;ref name=Lemons&gt;{{Cite book|last=Lemons|first=John|coauthors=Reginald Victor and Daniel Schaffer|title=Conserving biodiversity in arid regions: best practices in developing nations|page=243|accessdate=2010-02-14|url=http://books.google.co.in/books?id=b0IukXmOzGAC&amp;pg=PA243&amp;dq=Jessore+Sloth+Bear+Sanctuary&amp;lr=&amp;cd=13#v=onepage&amp;q=Jessore%20Sloth%20Bear%20Sanctuary&amp;f=false|publisher= Springer|year=2003|isbn=1-4020-7483-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=weed/&gt; The sanctuary area lies between the desert ecosystem and the dry deciduous type of ecosystem, and the forested area helps in arresting desertification and advancement of [[Thar desert]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gujaratpulse.com/book/export/html/58|title= Jessore Sloth Bear Sanctuary|accessdate=2010-02-15}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The nearest airport is [[Ahmedabad]] is {{convert|190|km|mi}} away. Nearest Railway station is at [[Palanpur]], {{convert|45|km|mi}} away and [[Iqbalgarh]] village is at {{convert|8|km|mi}} distance.{{cn|date=August 2012}} The Sanctuary also houses two temples (one of them is the Kedarnath Mahadev temple), which are frequented by a large number of pilgrims during October–November, and a protected sacred grove.&lt;ref name=Lemons/&gt;

==Flora and fauna==
;Flora
The vegetation in the sanctuary consists of arid to semiarid and dry deciduous thorny scrub.&lt;ref name=ecology&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://74.125.153.132/search?q=cache:2OLFNpXWlCEJ:envfor.nic.in/paryaabs/v22n14/em-34-eco.htm+Jessore+Sloth+Bear+Sanctuary&amp;cd=50&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=in|title=Ecology|work=Paper no 0501-153|accessdate=2010-02-15|author= Pandit BR, Patel Dax, Pandya Ushma|publisher= Bhavnagar University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A UNDP sponsored study of the [[Flora]] of the sanctuary has identified 406 species of plants (90 trees, 47 shrubs, 33 climbers, 194 herbs, 31 grasses, six pteridophytes, two bryophytes, one epiphyte, and two fungi). A further analysis indicates that the families of tree species are 13, shrubs 15, herbs 11 and climbers 13. Some of the species reportedly belong to the threatened category as per IUCN; these are: ''[[Pavonia arabica]]'', ''[[Tecomella undulata]]'', ''[[Capparis cartilaginea]]'', ''[[Dendrocalamus strictus]]'', ''[[Sterculia urens]]'' and [[Phoenix sylvestris|Silver Date Palm]] and ''Ceropegia odorata'', an endangered species. Six endemic species to India recorded are ''[[ogeissus sericea]]'', ''[[Chlorophytum|chlorophytum borivilianum]]'', ''Sterculia urens'', ''Tecomella undulata'', Silver Date Palm and ''Dendrocalamus strictus''. Further, 89 plants are recorded to have medicinal properties.&lt;ref name=diversity/&gt;

However, forest area is reportedly diminishing, and the corridor with hill area forests of Aravalli is also reducing, disrupting the migration of the bears. As a result, forest areas are reported only in patches. ''[[Prosopis juliflora]]'' called locally as ''gando baval'' has become the dominant vegetation affecting spread of local species, growth of goat and cattle population and forest fires; about 40 per cent of the green cover in the lower areas and 20 per cent in hilly regions are covered by this weed.&lt;ref name=Lemons/&gt;&lt;ref name=weed&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/Forest-of-weeds-Gando-baval-props-up-green-cover/articleshow/50482.cms|title= Forest of weeds: Gando baval props up green cover|accessdate=2010-02-15|publisher=[[The Times of India]]|date=2003-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Fauna
Apart from sloth bear, other fauna reported in the sanctuary are [[leopard]], [[sambar (deer)|sambar]], [[blue bull]], [[wild boar]], [[porcupine]], and a variety of birds.{{cn|date=August 2012}}  Other endangered species harboured by the sanctuary are jungle cat, civet, caracal, wolf and hyena.&lt;ref name=Lemons/&gt;

The faunal study by UNDP covered the herpetofaunal group. 14 species of [[amphibians]] and [[reptiles]] have been recorded here; the list includes [[Indian Python]] (''Python molurus'') an endangered species, [[Lissemys punctata|Indian Flap-shelled Turtle]] (''Lissemys punctata'') of vulnerable category and [[Mugger crocodile|Muggar]] (''Crocodylus palustris'') and [[Monitor lizard|Varanus]] (''Varanus bengalensis'') of endangered category. Threats faced by these species have been noted as water shortage, traffic, and hunting by snake charmers.&lt;ref name=diversity/&gt;

Reptiles found also include [[cobra]], [[Bungarus|krait]], several types of [[Viperidae|viper]] and [[monitor lizard]].&lt;ref name=Lemons/&gt;&lt;ref name=arkive&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.arkive.org/sloth-bear/melursus-ursinus/info.html|title=Sloth Bear|accessdate=2010-02-14|publisher=Arkive: Images of Life on earth}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Avifauna
Studies of [[Bird|avifauna]] in the sanctuary revealed 105 species, including migratory birds. The list includes: four near threatened category birds comprising [[Grey jungle fowl]] (''Gallus sonneratii''), [[White-bellied Minivet]] (''Pericrocotus erythropygus''), [[Indian Black Ibis]] (''Pseudibis papillosa'') and [[Painted stork]] (''Mycturia leucocephala''); the Vulnerable category (as per IUCN Red List) are [[White-winged Black Tit]] (''Parus nuchalis''), [[Asian Openbill]] (''Anastomus oscitans''), [[Indian White-rumped Vulture]] (''Gyps Bengalensis''), [[Indian Vulture]] (''Gyps indicus''), [[Red-headed Vulture]] (''Sarcogyps calvus'') and [[Red-necked Falcon]] (''Falco chicquera'').&lt;ref name=diversity/&gt;

;Mammalian fauna
20 species of mammalian fauna have been identified. Of these [[Indian Pangolin]] (''Manis crassicaudata'') and [[Sloth bear]] (''Melursus ursinus'') are near threatened and vulnerable respectively.&lt;ref name=diversity/&gt;

;Sloth bear
{{double image|right|Lippenbaer-24.jpg|150|Sloth bear.jpg|150|Left: Common Sloth Bear (''Melursus ursinus ursinus'') in India. Right: Sri Lankan Sloth Bear ''(Melursus ursinus inornatus)''}}
Sloth bear is an animal found in many parts of [[Asia]] including [[Nepal]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Bhutan]] and [[Bangladesh]]. Two subspecies have been recognized namely, the [[Indian Sloth Bear]] (''Melursus ursinus ursinus'') and the [[Sri Lankan Sloth Bear]] (''Melursus ursinus inornatus'').&lt;ref name=&quot;arkive&quot;/&gt;

Sloth bear is omnivorous, black and dark brown in colour with an yellowish patch on the chest, has large feet and claws, as tall as {{convert|5|-|6|ft|m}}, heavy in size (males weigh {{convert|175|-|310|lb|kg}}, females {{convert|120|-|210|lb|kg}}), runs as fast as humans and has a long muzzle. Their habitats can be dry forest or wet rain forest or grass lands with shrubs trees and stones. They eat insects, their favourite is [[termites]], live on fruits (mangoes and figs), grass and honey. Fifty percent of their diet is fruits during March to June, and termites and other insects the rest of the time. They have high sensory perception. It is the only bear with long hair on the ears. Its life span is estimated as 25 years.&lt;ref name= Haywood/&gt;&lt;ref name=sloth/&gt;

Study has established that the Sloth Bear prefers biodiversity zones in the sanctuary that are rich in fruit trees, such as ''[[Ficus glomerata]]'' and ''[[Diospyros melanoxylon]]'' (rich sweet fruits), and the presence of honey, ants, and termites.&lt;ref name=diversity/&gt;

==Threats==
[[File:Pushkar-bear and handler.jpg|thumb|right| A captive Sloth Bear (Melursus ursinus) and handler in Pushkar]]
The threats faced by the sanctuary, and the Sloth bear in particular, are: the disappearing forests due to anthropogenic and cattle pressures; destruction of termite hills (source of favourite food for the bear) by humans, capturing for training to perform in circuses (they are popular as &quot;dancing bears&quot;), travelling shows and fairs.&lt;ref name= Haywood/&gt; Poaching and trade in sloth bears or their parts has also been reported. Even the cubs are captured and removed from the sanctuary.&lt;ref name=IUCN/&gt;

The UNDP study has also listed threats to avifauna as deterioration of the habitat, overgrazing, quarrying (which causes noise pollution and dust), damage to ground vegetation by the invasive ''[[Prosopis juliflora]]'', scarcity of water, hunting, and anthropogenic pressure resulting in habitat destruction.&lt;ref name=diversity/&gt;

However, threat from the sloth bears is also reported to people and crops. The human-sloth bear conflict was scientifically examined for one year (between June 2007 and July 2008 in Jessore Sanctuary and also in the [[Mount Abu]] [[Sanctuary]], which revealed that there were human casualties due to attack by bears. Thirty such attacks on humans (more on males) in the forest, villages and crop fields were reported during the study period, with summer season recording the maximum number followed by monsoon and winter. Crop damage of varying degree by bears was also reported.&lt;ref name=conflict&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://oldwww.wii.gov.in/ars/2008/irs/18.htm|title= Human-sloth bear conflict in Mount Abu and Jessore Wildlife Sanctuaries and mitigation strategies|accessdate=2010-02-15|publisher=Government of India}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has caused fear among the villagers. However, under these conditions of threat to life and crops, the bears may be killed under the law to protect life or property.&lt;ref name=IUCN/&gt;

==Conservation==
Schedule I of the Indian Wildlife Protection Act of 1972 provides for legal protection of sloth bears. The [[CITES|Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species]] (CITES) as per list in Appendix I prohibits International trade of sloth bear.&lt;ref name=arkive/&gt;

To address the human-bear conflict it has been suggested that people may be educated about the conservation ethics, particularly among locals. It is suggested that, to resolve this conflict the basic issue of deteriorating habitat, which is the reason for the conflict between people and bears, improvements through government or community-based reforestation programmes may be promoted.&lt;ref name=IUCN/&gt;

It has also been noted that the population of sloth bears grows when they live in high profile reserves that protect species, such as tigers and elephants. It has been recommended that directly managed reserves would conserve the sloth bear and hence such reserves must be supported.&lt;ref name=arkive/&gt; 

Government of India has banned use of sloth bear for entertainment and there is also a 'Sloth Bear Welfare Project' in the country with the objective of putting an end to the use of sloth bears for entertainment. However, their number in such activity is still large. Many organizations are helping in the conservation and preservation of sloth bears in safe places. 

Proposals to create a biological corridor of four protected areas in the Aravalli hills as conservation area namely, the Jessore and Balaram Ambaji in Gujarat in [[Banaskantha district|Banskantha]] and [[Sabarkantha district|Sabarkantha]], and [[Mt. Abu]] and Fulwar-Ki-Nar in the districts of [[Udaipur]] and [[Sirohi]] in [[Rajasthan]] to be developed as multiple use zones, have been mooted since all these are sanctuaries for sloth bear. Community participation is also suggested in this plan.&lt;ref name=Swaminathan&gt;{{Cite book|last=Swaminathan|first=Dr.R.|title= Gujarat, perspectives of the future|page=263|accessdate=2010-02-14|url=http://books.google.co.in/books?id=7TQSrCrFhFUC&amp;pg=PA263&amp;dq=Jessore+Sloth+Bear+Sanctuary&amp;lr=&amp;cd=20#v=onepage&amp;q=Jessore%20Sloth%20Bear%20Sanctuary&amp;f=false|publisher= Academic Foundation|year=2008|isbn=81-7188-595-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[geometry]], the '''small dodecahemidodecahedron''' is a [[nonconvex uniform polyhedron]], indexed as U&lt;sub&gt;51&lt;/sub&gt;. Its [[vertex figure]] alternates two regular [[pentagon]]s and [[decagon]]s as a [[antiparallelogram|crossed quadrilateral]].

It is a [[hemipolyhedron]] with six decagonal faces passing through the model center.

== Related polyhedra ==

It shares its [[edge arrangement]] with the [[icosidodecahedron]] (its [[convex hull]], having the pentagonal faces in common), and with the [[small icosihemidodecahedron]] (having the decagonal faces in common).

'''James &quot;Jimmy&quot; Brain''' (11 September 1900 – 1971) was an [[England|English]] [[association football|football]] player.

Born in [[Bristol]], Brain started his career playing in [[Wales]], having an unsuccessful trial at [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]], before gaining a regular place at [[Ton Pentre F.C.|Ton Pentre]]. In 1923, he moved to [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]], and in his eight years with the Gunners became one of the club's most successful goalscorers. After a year in the reserve side, Brain started his Arsenal first-team career with a goal on his debut, a 1-0 win against local rivals [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] on 25 October 1924.

Brain was a prolific striker throughout his career, and was the club's top scorer for four seasons in a row, from [[1924-25 in English football|1924-25]] to [[1928-29 in English football|1928-29]]; this included 39 goals in the [[1925-26 in English football|1925-26]] season (second only to [[Ted Drake]]'s haul of 45 in [[1934-35 in English football|1934-35]]), which included four [[hat trick]]s. The next season, [[1926-27 in English football|1926-27]], Brain scored 34 goals, this haul including two four-goal tallies against [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]] and [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]]. Brain's goalscoring feats helped Arsenal reach their first [[FA Cup]] final, in 1926-27, though a mistake by [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]] [[Dan Lewis (footballer)|Dan Lewis]] meant Arsenal lost 1-0 to Cardiff City.

However Brain's form dropped and in [[1929-30 in English football|1929-30]] he lost out in competing for the front spot with [[Jack Lambert (association footballer)|Jack Lambert]], [[David Jack]] and [[Dave Halliday]] all getting the nod ahead of him, meaning Brain only played six league matches this season. Brain therefore missed the Gunners' 1930 Cup final win over [[Huddersfield Town F.C.|Huddersfield Town]]; Jack and Lambert led the line that day. However, the following season, [[1930-31 in English football|1930-31]], Brain finally won a medal after playing sixteen matches (scoring four goals) in Arsenal's very first [[Football League First Division|First Division]] title-winning season. Brain's final appearance in an Arsenal shirt was a 2-0 win over [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]] on 21 March 1931.

By now, Brain's age was catching up with him, and he had been overtaken in the goalscoring stakes by both Lambert and Jack. He left Arsenal for Tottenham for £2,500 in September 1931, becoming one of the few players to have moved directly between the two rival clubs. In total, he scored 139 goals in 232 appearances for Arsenal, making him the Gunners' joint-fifth top scorer of all time, and he was the first player ever to score 100 goals for the club, a feat he achieved in a 6-3 win over [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] on 7 March 1928. However, he never played for [[England national football team|England]]; he managed to secure a trial for the national team but was never actually selected.

By the time Brain had joined Spurs he was in his thirties, and only played 47 times for them, scoring 10 goals, before leaving in 1934. He played his final years out at [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea Town]] and [[Bristol City F.C.|Bristol City]]. After retiring as a player, Brain managed first [[King's Lynn F.C.|King's Lynn]] and then [[Cheltenham Town F.C.|Cheltenham Town]] from 1939 until 1948, after which he retired completely from football. He died in 1971, at the age of 71.

==History==
[[File:Advertiser Building.JPG|thumb|The office of the ''Messenger'' group of newspapers in Waymouth St, Adelaide]]
The ''Salisbury, Elizabeth and Gawler News-Review'', as it was originally known, was first published on 3 July 1968. The creation of the paper reflected the growing population of Adelaide's northern suburbs in the 1960s. In 1977, the paper added Munno Para to its name to become the ''Salisbury, Elizabeth, Gawler and Munno Para News-Review'', In addition to the Wednesday edition, a Friday edition, known as ''The Weekender'', was established on 7 July 1978. ''The Weekender'' ceased production on 16 May 1980.&lt;ref&gt;[http://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/2742614 National Library of Australia]&lt;/ref&gt; From 6 June 1984 to 13 February 1985, the paper was known as the ''Salisbury, Elizabeth, Gawler Messenger''. The News Review named was revived from 20 February 1985, with the paper renamed the ''News Review Messenger''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/1508803?lookfor=News%20Review%20Messenger&amp;offset=1&amp;max=10 National Library of Australia]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, the paper was split in two, with dedicated Salisbury and Elizabeth/Gawler editions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3786">'''Motorcycle speedway''' was first staged in [[Leicester]] in 1928. It has continued on and off until the present day, with [[Leicester Lions]] currently competing in the [[Speedway Premier League|Premier League]].

==Leicester Stadium==
{{Main|Leicester Stadium (speedway team)}}
The first speedway to be staged in Leicester was on a dirt track constructed inside the greyhound racing track at [[Leicester Stadium]] in 1928. The team based there joined the [[Speedway English Dirt Track League|English Dirt Track League]] in 1929 finishing 5th, with [[Syd Jackson (speedway rider)|Syd Jackson]] and [[Billy Elmore]] the leading riders.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hoare&quot;&gt;Hoare, Ron (1979) ''Speedway Panorama'', Haynes, ISBN 0-85429-252-7, p. 122-3&lt;/ref&gt; The team were referred to as 'Leicester Stadium' to differentiate them from the other team that operated in Leicester, the [[Leicester Super]] team.

The team competed in the [[Speedway Southern League|Southern League]] in 1930, with [[Cyril &quot;Squib&quot; Burton]] emerging at the team's top rider.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hoare&quot; /&gt; The Stadium team completed only part of the 1931 season. 

==Leicester Super==
{{Main|Leicester Super}}
A new track was constructed at the Leicester Super Speedway on Melton Road, which opened in 1929.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jones&quot;&gt;Jones, Alan (2010) ''Speedway in Leicester: The Pre-War Years'', Automedia, p. 37, 105-9&lt;/ref&gt; A team based there competed in the Northern League in both 1930 and 1931, but failed to complete either season. 

==Leicester Hounds==
Speedway was revived on a relaid track at Leicester Stadium in 1937, with Leicester Hounds competing in the [[Speedway Provincial League|Provincial League]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Jones&quot; /&gt;

==Leicester Hunters==
{{main|Leicester Hunters}}
Leicester Hunters formed in 1948, and began competing in the National League in 1949. They competed in the top division of British speedway between 1957 and 1961, before dropping down to the [[Speedway Provincial League|Provincial League]] in 1962, which was their final season.

==Leicester Lions==
{{main|Leicester Lions}}
Leicester Lions began in 1968, when the team transferred from [[Long Eaton Speedway|Long Eaton]]. They competed in the [[Speedway British League|British League]] until their closure in 1983, when they lost their home after the stadium was sold.

The Lions name was revived in the 2000s, with occasional challenge matches before the team returned to league competition at a new stadium in [[Beaumont Leys]] in 2011.

==Indoor speedway==
Speedway was also staged on an indoor track at [[Granby Halls]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Jones3&quot;&gt;Jones, Alan (2010) ''Speedway in Leicester: The Lions Roar'', Automedia, p. 114-8&lt;/ref&gt; The first event was the Midland Individual Championship in January 1972, which was won by [[James Bond (speedway rider)|James Bond]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Jones3&quot; /&gt;

==Around Leicestershire==
[[Wilf Plant]] set up a training track near [[Melton Mowbray]] in 1936.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bamford&quot;&gt;Bamford, Robert &amp; Jarvis, John (2001) ''Homes of British Speedway'', Tempus, ISBN 0-7524-2210-3, p. 166&lt;/ref&gt; Speedway was also staged at the greyhound stadium on Saxby Road in Melton Mowbray in 1949.&lt;ref name=&quot;JonesHunters&quot;&gt;Jones, Alan (2004) ''Speedway in Leicester: The Hunters Era'', Automedia, p. 105-7&lt;/ref&gt; The Melton Mowbray Motorcycle Club, chaired by Plant, staged several meetings on a cinder track there.&lt;ref name=&quot;JonesHunters&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bamford&quot; /&gt;

[[Paddy Mills (speedway rider)|Paddy Mills]] set up a training track in a field in [[Syston]] in 1952, running training sessions attended by several riders who went on to represent Leicester Hunters, including [[Ivor Brown (speedway rider)|Ivor Brown]] and [[Bryan Elliott]].&lt;ref name=&quot;JonesHunters&quot; /&gt;

The '''Guyon Hotel''' is a historic former hotel in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]]. The hotel was designed by [[Jens Jensen (landscape architect)|Jens Jensen]] in 1927 and was built in red and cream brick with arched windows on two floors and exquisite, detailed [[terra cotta]] ornaments typical of Jensen's work. After the hotel opened in 1928, owner J. Louis Guyon mounted two AM radio towers to broadcast his radio station, WGES; the station aired morally conservative programming and music.&lt;ref name=&quot;moser&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Moser|first=Whet|title=A Short History of Chicago’s Beautiful, Decrepit Guyon Hotel|journal=[[Chicago (magazine){{!}}Chicago]]|date=April 27, 2012|url=http://www.chicagomag.com/Chicago-Magazine/The-312/April-2012/A-Short-History-of-Chicagos-Beautiful-Decrepit-Guyon-Hotel/|accessdate=January 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Guyon sold WGES in the 1930s, and it left the hotel in the mid-1940s, but it continues to broadcast as [[WVON]]. In the late 1940s, the AM towers were replaced with an FM tower, and WOAK began broadcasts from the hotel. WOAK became [[WFMT]] in the 1950s and began airing [[classical music]]; the station has since moved but still broadcasts classical music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory - Nomination Form: Guyon Hotel|url=http://ihpa.greatarc.com/pdfs/201521.pdf|publisher=[[National Park Service]]|accessdate=January 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

After the hotel closed, the building was renovated and converted to affordable housing in the 1980s by the non-profit group Bethel New Life. Former President [[Jimmy Carter]] stayed in the renovated hotel for a week while working on a rehabilitation project with [[Habitat for Humanity]]; his room was reportedly &quot;roach-infested&quot; and &quot;furnished with only a couch and a milk crate&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;moser&quot;/&gt; The housing effort ultimately failed when Bethel New Life ran out of funds. The building currently lies vacant and has changed possession four times since 2005. Due to building code violations, the hotel is in city demolition court; it is considered one of the ten most endangered landmarks in Illinois by the [[Landmarks Preservation Council of Illinois]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hotel Guyon|url=http://www.landmarks.org/ten_most_2012_hotel_guyon.htm|work=2012 Ten Most Endangered Historic Places|publisher=[[Landmarks Illinois]]|accessdate=January 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Guyon Hotel was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] on May 9, 1985.&lt;ref name=&quot;nris&quot;/&gt;

The '''Yonge–University–Spadina Line''' (officially Route '''1 Yonge–University–Spadina Subway''')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www3.ttc.ca/Subway/index.jsp |title=TTC Subway/RT |publisher=Toronto Transit Commission |accessdate=February 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the oldest and busiest [[Toronto subway and RT|subway line in Toronto]], Ontario, Canada. It is operated by the [[Toronto Transit Commission]], has 32 stations&lt;ref name=&quot;Subway Ridership&quot;/&gt; and is {{convert|30.2|km|mi|abbr=on}} in length&lt;ref name=&quot;TTC 2011 Stats&quot;/&gt;. It opened in 1954, and had extensions completed in 1963, 1973, 1974, 1978, and 1996. [[North York Centre (TTC)|North York Centre Station]] opened on an existing section of line in 1987.

The line's name has been changed as it was extended. It was called &quot;the subway&quot; (Yonge subway is its [[retronym]]) until 1963, then the &quot;Yonge–University Line&quot; until 1978, when the Spadina section was added. Briefly in 1966, the Yonge–University subway ran in two branches: one west along Bloor to Keele (Yonge–University–Bloor), the other east along Bloor and Danforth to Woodbine (Yonge–University–Danforth).

Although only two stations are on [[Spadina Avenue|Spadina Road]], a larger portion of the line was originally planned to follow the [[Spadina Expressway]]. The part of the expressway that was built was renamed [[Allen Road|William R. Allen Road]], but the name of the line was never changed. It is numbered as &quot;Route 1&quot; (formerly route 602),&lt;ref&gt;[[Toronto Transit Commission]], [http://transit.toronto.on.ca/archives/reports/1991.pdf Scheduled Service Summary], Board Period Commencing Sunday, July 21, 1991&lt;/ref&gt; but its route number is used by the TTC predominantly for internal purposes and is rarely used by the public or on TTC maps.

The subway runs from approximately 6:00&amp;nbsp;am to 1:30&amp;nbsp;am Monday to Saturday and 9:00&amp;nbsp;am to 1:30&amp;nbsp;am on Sunday. The subway runs every 4–5 minutes, with frequent service (2–3 minutes) during rush hour periods. There is limited service (5 minutes) northbound from [[St. Clair West (TTC)|St. Clair West Station]] from 6:00&amp;nbsp;am to 9:00&amp;nbsp;am Monday to Friday.

The 320 Yonge [[Blue Night Network|Blue Night]] bus provides late-night service when the subway is not in operation. This service operates frequently along Yonge between [[Steeles Avenue]] and [[Union Station (Toronto)|Union Station]] ([[Front Street (Toronto)|Front Street]]). No bus service follows the University–Spadina line, though other [[night bus service]]s, such as the 310 Bathurst, pass near some of the stations.  Bus service is extended on Sundays to account for the 9:00&amp;nbsp;am start.

== History ==
[[File:1949 Toronto TTC YongeSubwayConstruction1.jpg|thumb|left|Construction on Yonge Street in 1949]]

{{Yonge-University-Spadina Line Map}}

On March 30, 1954, after five years of work, the first [[rapid transit|subway]] in Canada opened to the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.railways.incanada.net/candate/candate.htm| work=Colin Churcher's Railway Pages| date=March 17, 2006| title=Significant dates in Canadian railway history| accessdate=March 29, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Toronto TTC history&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=City of Toronto| url=http://www.toronto.ca/ttc/history.htm| title=Toronto Transit Commission – History| year=2006|accessdate=March 29, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original [[Yonge Street]] subway line went from [[Union (TTC)|Union subway station]] near the [[Union Station (Toronto)|namesake railway station]] north to [[Eglinton (TTC)|Eglinton Station]]. [[Premier of Ontario|Premier]] [[Leslie Frost]] and [[List of mayors of Toronto|Mayor]] [[Allan A. Lamport]], among other important people, rode the first train that morning, going north from the yards at [[Davisville (TTC)|Davisville Station]], and then from Eglinton south along the entire line. The line was then opened to the public, and that day at 2:30&amp;nbsp;pm, the last streetcar to travel Yonge Street made its final trip.

Nine years later, the University segment of the line opened, continuing the line from Union north to [[St. George (TTC)|St. George Station]].

[[File:Yonge subway home demolition.png|thumb|left|Homes were demolished east of Yonge Street near Summerhill in order to construct a [[cut-and-cover]] tunnel]]
On March 31, 1973, the line was extended north to [[York Mills (TTC)|York Mills Station]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

 | title     = Yonge Subway Extension to York Mills

and the next year to [[Finch (TTC)|Finch Station]] as part of the North Yonge Extension project, bringing the subway to North York. Stations were also planned for Glencairn (between Eglinton and Lawrence, though [[Glencairn (TTC)|another Glencairn Station]] would be built on the Spadina line), Glen Echo (between Lawrence and York Mills) and Empress (between Sheppard and Finch, later opened as [[North York Centre (TTC)|North York Centre Station]]). In 1978, the Spadina segment of the line was opened, going from the north terminus of the University line to [[Wilson (TTC)|Wilson Station]].

In 1987, the [[North York Centre (TTC)|North York Centre]] station was added between Sheppard and Finch Stations.

On August 11, 1995 at 6:02&amp;nbsp;pm, the [[1995 Russell Hill subway accident|Russell Hill subway accident]] occurred as a southbound subway train heading toward [[Dupont (TTC)|Dupont Station]] crashed under Russell Hill Drive, killing three passengers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=(Published by Toronto Star on August 6, 2005 11:36&amp;nbsp;am) |url=http://transit.toronto.on.ca/archives/data/200508061136.shtml |title=Transit Toronto – News Archive: 10 years after |publisher=Transit.toronto.on.ca |date=August 6, 2005 |accessdate=February 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This accident prompted the Toronto Transit Commission to review its practices and put resources into safety.

In 1996, the Spadina expansion was opened, adding one new station, [[Downsview (TTC)|Downsview]].

== Future expansion ==
=== Spadina extension ===

[[File:YorkUniversitySubwayConstruction2.jpg|thumb|left|Construction underway on York University Campus]]
Construction has begun on an extension to [[York University]] northwest of Downsview Station, and into the city of [[Vaughan]] to the proposed [[Vaughan Metropolitan Centre]] at Jane Street and Highway 7. Six new stations are planned along the {{Convert|8.6|km|mi|abbr=on}} route, with {{Convert|6.2|km|mi|abbr=on}} in the City of Toronto and {{Convert|2.4|km|mi|abbr=on}} in [[Regional Municipality of York|York Region]].&lt;ref name=&quot;TTC Spadina&quot;/&gt; Subway service on the extension is estimated to begin by the autumn of 2016.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ttc.ca/About_the_TTC/Commission_reports_and_information/Commission_meetings/2012/October_24/Supplementary_Reports/TYSSE_Schedule_Statu.pdf] TYSSE Schedule Status Update &lt;/ref&gt;

Approximately 2,900 new parking spaces will be built at three stations along the extension, in order to encourage commuters to use the subway system. [[Black Creek Pioneer Village (TTC)|Black Creek Pioneer Village Station]] will have the most at 1,900 spaces, while Highway 407 Station will have 600 spaces, and Finch West Station will have 400 parking spaces.&lt;ref name=&quot;FAQ&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www3.ttc.ca/About_the_TTC/Projects_and_initiatives/Spadina_subway_extension/FAQ.jsp |title=TTC Toronto-York Spadina Subway Extension Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=.ttc.ca |accessdate=February 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The estimated cost of this extension is $2.09 billion in 2006 dollars, which will have escalated to $2.63 billion considering costs at the year of occurrence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ttc.ca/postings/gso-comrpt/documents/report/f3518/TYSSE_Project_Delivery_Strategy_Process.pdf | title=Toronto-York Spadina Subway Extension Project Delivery Strategy Process | accessdate=March 31, 2008 | author=TTC | date=March 5, 2008|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Province of Ontario has deposited $870 million into the Move Ontario Trust. The federal government has committed $697 million, but only released $75 million at the start of its fall election campaign. The City of Toronto and the [[Regional Municipality of York]] have committed to fund one-third of total project costs, with Toronto will contributing $526 million and York Region contributing $352 million.&lt;ref name=&quot;TTC Spadina&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www3.ttc.ca/About_the_TTC/Projects_and_initiatives/Spadina_subway_extension/Overview.jsp |title=TTC Spadina subway extension website |publisher=.ttc.ca |accessdate=February 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, a temporary [[bus rapid transit|busway]] was planned between Downsview Station and the campus, but was opposed by the university, which felt it would lessen government willingness to extend the subway. After numerous delays, construction on the [[York University Busway]] started on July 25, 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mackenzie |first=Robert |url=http://transit.toronto.on.ca/archives/weblog/2008/07/25-ground-bre.shtml |title=Ground-breaking for York University busway project today |publisher=transit.toronto.on.ca |date=July 25, 2008 |accessdate=February 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a short section of the busway opened on September 6, 2009&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mackenzie |first=Robert |url=http://transit.toronto.on.ca/archives/weblog/2009/09/05-ttc_revise.shtml#t196 |title=TTC revises routes and services, September 6: 196 York University Rocket |publisher=transit.toronto.on.ca |date=September 5, 2009 |accessdate=February 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the remainder opened on November 20, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mackenzie |first=Robert |url=http://transit.toronto.on.ca/archives/weblog/2009/11/14-york_unive.shtml |title=York University busway opens, November 20 |publisher=transit.toronto.on.ca |date=November 14, 2009 |accessdate=February 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first construction contract was awarded on February 27, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.toronto.ca/ttc/spadina_extension/welcome.htm | title=Spadina Subway Extension February 2008 Update

The TTC purchased two [[tunnel boring machine]]s in the fall of 2010 from LOVAT Inc. for $58.4 million to dig tunnels on this extension, and two more boring machines were delivered in the spring of 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://transit.toronto.on.ca/archives/weblog/2009/08/08-extending_.shtml|title=Extending the Spadina subway: Boring news|last=Mackenzie|first=Robert|date=August 8, 2009|publisher=Transit Toronto|accessdate=August 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yorkregion.com/news/local/article/818877--major-transit-delay |title=Major transit delay – Rapid transit project pushed back to 2020 |publisher=Yorkregion.com |date=May 20, 2010 |accessdate=February 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tunnel boring for the extension began on June 17, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www3.ttc.ca/News/2011/June/0617_boring_begins.jsp &quot;Tunnel boring for Toronto-York Spadina Subway Extension begins&quot;] TTC. June 17, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The extension north of Steeles Avenue has been criticized in the press for several reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thestar.com/News/GTA/article/467117|title=New subway in sight at last|last=Benzie|first=Robert|coauthors=Tess Kalinowski|date=July 25, 2008|work=Toronto Star|accessdate=July 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The TTC had originally intended to extend the subway as far as York University, with a vast bus terminal complex at the future [[Black Creek Pioneer Village (TTC)|Black Creek Pioneer Village Station]]. However, provincial funding hinged on the line crossing the municipal border. The area around the future [[Vaughan Metropolitan Centre (TTC)|Vaughan Metropolitan Centre Station]] is occupied by [[big-box store]]s and highways, and lacks the dense development that surrounds most other subway stations. Although a station is planned for the [[Highway 407 (TTC)|407 Transitway]], most GO Transit buses will terminate at Black Creek Pioneer Village Station, so that avoid commuters do not have to pay an additional TTC fare to reach York University.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} The TTC{{when|date=December 2010}} announced that it will incorporate a system in which GO Transit users do not have to pay an extra fare to use the subway to arrive at York University Station from the 407 Transitway.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} In addition, the 407 Transitway station is being built within vacant farmland.

=== Yonge extension ===
Proposals have also been put forward to extend the Yonge Street portion of the line beyond Finch to Steeles and into York Region, most likely ending at the [[Richmond Hill Centre Terminal]] of [[Viva (bus rapid transit)|Viva bus rapid transit]]. On June 15, 2007, the Ontario government announced plans to fund this extension as part of a network of rapid transit growth called [[MoveOntario 2020]].&lt;ref&gt;Government of Ontario (2007). [http://www.premier.gov.on.ca/news/Product.asp?ProductID=1385 MoveOntario 2020 Projects] Retrieved on October 14, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although completion of this subway expansion is many years away, a local group in York Region is lobbying for the cancellation of the planned busway along this route,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yorkregion.com/Opinion/Editorials/article/43097 |title=– Editorials – Don't count on Yonge subway just yet |publisher=Yorkregion.com |date=April 24, 2007 |accessdate=February 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; which would be a part of York Region's Viva bus rapid transit.

The Yonge portion of the subway line operates at capacity during the morning rush hour, and could not carry the additional riders attracted to this extension. Once a new signal system is in place, the TTC claims it will be able to increase the frequency of trains from 2 minutes 30 seconds to every 1 minute 45 seconds. As of 2011, there was no proposal to increase capacity of Bloor-Yonge station, already the busiest in the entire network serving over 400,000 passengers each day.

GO Transit's long-term plan also calls for all-day service on its Richmond Hill line that would see express trains running every 15 minutes between its Langstaff Station adjacent to the Richmond Hill Centre terminal, and Union station in downtown Toronto, calling into question the additional need for a subway extension.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}

Toronto council approved the plan in principle in January 2009, but added caveats indicating that upgrades within Toronto would be needed to support the additional capacity from York Region. The plan, as approved, lists six new stations: Cummer/Drewery, Steeles, Clark, Royal Orchard, Longbridge/Langstaff, and Richmond Hill Centre.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalpost.com/news/canada/toronto/story.html?id=1146889 ''dead link'']{{dead link|date=February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; TTC has no plans to expand this subway line in the &quot;near future&quot; but have Viva Bus Rapid Transit bus lanes along Yonge Street from Finch Avenue to Highway 7, which would go into full service by 2013. {{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

== Stations ==
{{Main|List of Toronto subway and RT stations}}

[[File:Looking south to Rosedale station.jpg|thumb|left|An open cut section looking south to [[Rosedale (TTC)|Rosedale Station]] from atop the Rowanwood Portal]]

The line forms a rough U-shape. Its western leg starts at the northern terminus at [[Downsview (TTC)|Downsview Station]], at [[Sheppard Avenue]] and [[Allen Road]]. The line follows the Allen Road, which becomes a short expressway with the subway line travelling in its median for {{convert|6|km|mi|abbr=on}}. Continuing southeast below the [[Castle Frank Brook|Cedarvale and Nordheimer Ravines]], it turns south under a short stretch of Spadina Road.

After sharing the [[Bloor–Danforth line|Bloor-Danforth Line's]] [[Spadina (TTC)|Spadina]] and [[St. George (TTC)|St. George]] stations, it turns south again under [[Queen's Park (Toronto)|Queen's Park]], passing to one side of the Ontario Legislature, and running the full length of University Avenue beyond. It turns east onto Front Street to serve [[Union (TTC)|Union Station]], Toronto's main railway terminus, and then north.

The eastern leg runs straight up [[Yonge Street]] for {{convert|16|km|mi|abbr=on}}, crossing the Bloor–Danforth Line again at [[Bloor-Yonge (TTC)|Bloor-Yonge]] and the [[Sheppard line|Sheppard Line]] at [[Sheppard–Yonge (TTC)|Sheppard–Yonge]], before reaching its northern terminus at [[Finch (TTC)|Finch Station]]. A roughed-in station exists below Queen Station for the proposed Queen streetcar subway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=(Last Modified on November 28, 2010 10:46&amp;nbsp;am) |url=http://transit.toronto.on.ca/subway/5006.shtml |title=Toronto's Lost Subway Stations |publisher=transit.toronto.on.ca |date=November 28, 2010 |accessdate=February 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This section often suffers from severe overcrowding during peak times, especially in the area immediately south of Bloor-Yonge station.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Originally published April 2008 |url=http://www.torontolife.com/features/monster-jam/ |title=Monster-Jam |publisher=Toronto Life |accessdate=February 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:T1NorthboundStPatrick.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A [[T-series (Toronto subway car)|T1]] train pulls into [[St. Patrick (TTC)|St. Patrick station]] on the University line]]

The line is generally underground, but has several surface or elevated sections between Downsview and Eglinton West, and between Bloor and Eglinton; some portions of the section between Bloor and Eglinton were originally open and have since been covered over to permit other uses above the tracks. Sections between Bloor-Yonge and the track short of [[Summerhill (TTC)|Summerhill]], and between [[St. Clair (TTC)|St. Clair]] and [[Eglinton (TTC)|Eglinton]] remain in their original open state. Between Summerhill and St. Clair, the track was originally in open cut, but has since been covered over. Evidence of this can be seen in the tunnel: there are no columns or walls between tracks, and ballast and drainage ditches are present, something not seen in the rest of the subway system. There are also tree stumps and the stubs of lamp posts in the tunnel. There are also clues outdoors: seemingly useless railings along the sides of a nearby street, which was once on an exposed bridge, and empty lots following the trains' right-of-way marked with signs warning heavy vehicles and equipment to keep off because they might fall through to the columnless tunnel below.

Most of the tunnel was constructed by a cut-and-cover method, but some was bored, as noted below. All stations, whether by transfer or fare-paid terminal, connect to surface TTC bus and/or streetcar routes. Other surface and train connections are noted below.

In late 2010, 16 stations had elevators for [[wheelchair]] [[accessibility|access]]. Elevator installations are underway at [[Lawrence West (TTC)|Lawrence West]] and [[St. Andrew (TTC)|St. Andrew]] stations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www3.ttc.ca/Service_Advisories/Construction/Lawrence_West_Elevator_Construction.jsp |title=Lawrence West Station – Elevator Construction – Update |publisher=.ttc.ca |accessdate=February 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www3.ttc.ca/Service_Advisories/Construction/St_Andrew_elevator_installation.jsp |title=St Andrew Station – Elevator Construction |publisher=.ttc.ca |accessdate=February 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The preferred alignment and placement for four stations for the extension beyond Downsview Station to serve [[York University]] were finalized in September 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.city.toronto.on.ca/ttc/spadina_extension/prefered_alignment.htm |title=Spadina North extension preferred alignment |publisher=City.toronto.on.ca |date=February 12, 2012 |accessdate=February 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Six stations are planned: the tentative name for the new terminus in the [[Vaughan Metropolitan Centre]] is &quot;[[Vaughan Metropolitan Centre (TTC)|Vaughan Centre]]&quot; based on the precedent set by [[North York Centre (TTC)|North York Centre]] and [[Scarborough Centre (TTC)|Scarborough Centre]], with intermediate stations called &quot;[[Highway 407 (TTC)|Highway 407]]&quot;, &quot;[[Black Creek Pioneer Village (TTC)|Black Creek Pioneer Village]]&quot;, &quot;[[York University (TTC)|York University]]&quot;, &quot;[[Finch West (TTC)|Finch West]]&quot;, and &quot;[[Downsview Park (TTC)|Downsview Park]]&quot;, with plans to rename Downsview Station &quot;Sheppard West&quot;. This extension will likely replace the portion of [[York Region Transit]]'s [[Viva Orange]] bus rapid transit line that covers the Downsview – York University route.

=== Design ===
[[Image:Eglinton Station Vitrolite.jpg|left|200px|thumb|[[Eglinton (TTC)|Eglinton station's]] Vitrolite-tiled walls are the last such station wall treatment left in the system]]
The original design of the oldest stations in the subway system, which are on the Yonge line (from [[Union (TTC)|Union]] to [[Eglinton (TTC)|Eglinton]]), are mainly utilitarian and characterized by [[vitreous marble]] wall tiles and the use of the [[Toronto Subway Font]] for station names. Eglinton Station is the only station to retain this wall treatment, though Queen Station retains a narrow band of original blue Vitrolite tiles near the ceiling at platform as well.

The design of the stations on the University line was mainly utilitarian and this style (sometimes referred to as “bathroom modern”) was later used for the Bloor–Danforth line as well.  [[Queen's Park (TTC)|Queen's Park]] and [[St. Patrick (TTC)|St. Patrick]] stations have circular and semi-circular cross-sections because they are constructed in bored tunnels.

[[Lawrence (TTC)|Lawrence]], [[York Mills (TTC)|York Mills]], [[Sheppard–Yonge (TTC)|Sheppard]], and [[Finch (TTC)|Finch]] Stations are similar to each other in design, but have different colour schemes: Lawrence is red and cream, York Mills is light and dark green, Sheppard is yellow and dark blue, and Finch is light grey, medium grey, and dark grey.

The Spadina line has of unique art and architecture for each station.  [[Glencairn (TTC)|Glencairn]] and [[Yorkdale (TTC)|Yorkdale]] Stations had their art removed.

[[North York Centre (TTC)|North York Centre station]], being an infill station, has a design that is very different from the other stations in the earlier North Yonge extension.

[[Downsview (TTC)|Downsview]] is the newest station on this line and also has art and architecture that is different from the earlier Spadina line.

The Spadina north extension to [[Vaughan Metropolitan Centre]] will feature unique art and architecture as well.

== Voice announcement system ==
As with all other subway lines, the Yonge–University–Spadina line uses an automated voice announcement system on board its trains to announce each stop as the train arrives. The [[H-series (Toronto subway car)|H5]] and [[T-series (Toronto subway car)|T1]] trains use a pre-recorded female human voice, recorded by TTC employee, Susan Bigoni, while the new Toronto Rocket trains use a built-in female computerized voice along with visual displays displaying the next stop, similar to the system used on TTC's surface vehicles (streetcar and bus routes).

==Toronto Rocket==
[[Image:Toronto Rocket.JPG|right|thumb|250px|A Toronto Rocket train at Rosedale Station]]
{{main|Toronto Rocket}}
Based on Bombardier's [[Movia]] trains, the articulated [[Toronto Rocket]] (TR) series trains were scheduled for delivery starting between late 2009 and early 2010, but the initial delivery was delayed until late 2010 due to production problems. The first TR train entered revenue service on July 21, 2011. There were roughly 30 trains operating or available for service in March 2013. They are the only subway trains operating in [[North America]] with a &quot;six-car fixed&quot; articulated configuration with full-open gangways, allowing riders to move freely through the entire train. New features include electronic lighted route maps that indicate the train's position, automated audible and visual stop announcement system with displays that indicate the name of the next station and arrows pointing to the side of the train on which the doors will open at the next stop, [[closed-circuit television]] security cameras, anti-bacterial handholds, video screens, passenger alarm intercoms, and emergency evacuation ramps at both ends of the train. The exterior [[destination sign|destination]] and train run number boards are outfitted with digital orange [[light-emitting diode|LED]] displays, while all other previous train models use back-lit rollsigns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www3.ttc.ca/About_the_TTC/Projects_and_initiatives/New_Subway_Train/Overview_and_key_features.jsp |title=New Subway Train – Overview and Key Features |publisher=.ttc.ca |accessdate=February 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The TR series trains will gradually replace the system's oldest subway cars, including the [[H-series (Toronto subway car)|H5]] series trains on the Yonge–University–Spadina (Y-U-S) line and the H6 series trains on the [[Bloor–Danforth line]], most of which have been in revenue service since the 1970s. In turn, T1 series trains operating on the Y-U-S subway are expected to move onto the Bloor–Danforth line.  Once all of the TR trains have been delivered, the Y-U-S line will operate exclusively with the TR series trains, allowing integration with the upgraded signalling system for the transition to the automatic train control system. It will also allow for expansion in service and to meet future ridership demands for the Spadina subway extension to Vaughan.

== Automatic train control ==
The TTC estimates that [[Automatic Train Control|automatic train control]] on the Yonge–University–Spadina line could be installed by 2016.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} When this system is installed, the TTC will be able to run trains as often as every 105 seconds. The limit of the signal system now is every 150 seconds, the interval at which trains operate at rush hours.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2829">'''Reinhold Klotz''' (1807–1870) was a [[Germany|German]] [[Classics|classical]] scholar.

==Biography==
Klotz was born in [[Stollberg]] near [[Chemnitz]] in [[Saxony]] on 13 March 1807. He studied at the [[University of Leipzig]] and became assistant professor there in 1832. In 1849 he became a full professor in succession to [[Gottfried Hermann]], and held this post until his death in Kleinschocher ([[Leipzig]]) on 10 August 1870. Klotz was a man of unwearied industry, and devoted special attention to [[Latin]] literature. During the [[Revolutions of 1848]] and the following years, he showed himself a strong [[conservatism|conservative]].

==Works==
He was the author of editions of several classical authors, of which the most important were: the complete works of ''Cicero'' (2nd ed. 1869-1874); ''Clement of Alexandria'' (1831–1834); ''Euripides'' (1841–1867), in continuation of August Julius Edmund Pflugk's edition, but unfinished; ''Terence'' (1838–1840), with the commentaries of [[Aelius Donatus]] and [[:de:Eugraphius|Eugraphius]]. Mention should also be made of ''Handwörterbuch der lateinischen Sprache'' (5th ed., 1874); ''Römische Litteraturgeschichte'' (1847), of which only the introductory volume appeared; an edition of the treatise ''Liber de Graecae linguae particulis'' (1835–1842) of Matthaeus Devarius (or Devares), a learned [[Corfu|Corfiote]] (c. 1500-1570), and corrector of the [[Greek language|Greek]] manuscripts in the [[Vatican City|Vatican]]; the posthumous ''Index Ciceronianus'' (1872) and ''Handbuch der lateinischen Stilistik'' (1874). From 1831-1855 Klotz was editor of the ''Neue Jahrbücher far Philologie'' (Leipzig). With Friedrich Lübker and Ernst Eduard Hudemann, he worked on a Latin dictionary (1847-57).

==Further reading==
A memoir by his son Richard will be found in the ''Jahrbücher'' for 1871, pp.&amp;nbsp;154-163.

The '''Eternal derby of Slovenian football''', simply known as the '''Eternal derby''' ({{lang-sl|Večni derbi}}) or '''Slovenian derby''' ({{lang-sl|Slovenski derbi}}) was a [[List of association football club rivalries by country|major football rivalry]] between [[NK Maribor|Maribor]] and [[NK Olimpija Ljubljana (defunct)|Olimpija Ljubljana]], which was dissolved in 2004. Although the old Olimpija was officially dissolved at the end of 2004 it was still allowed to finish the 2004–05 season, which was at the time already in progress.

In 2005 a new club, under the name of NK Bežigrad was founded and later changed its name several times until it eventually became known as [[NK Olimpija Ljubljana (2005)|Olimpija Ljubljana]]. Because most of the fans that supported the dissolved Olimpija simply started to support Bežigrad, the continuation of the rivalry is considered by most Slovenian media and fans, as the matches between Maribor and the new Olimpija Ljubljana, established in 2005 as NK Bežigrad, The new club consider themselves as the spiritual continuation of the 2004 dissolved club. However, legally, the current Olimpija Ljubljana is a distinct and separate club, and is not entitled to claim the history and honours won by the old Olimpija Ljubljana. [[Football Association of Slovenia]], [[Association of 1. SNL]] and [[UEFA]] does not recognize the titles and statistics before 2005. Neither does the legislation of the [[Republic of Slovenia]].

==History and rivalry culture==

===in Yugoslavia===
The rivalry traced its roots back in the early 1960s and the time of [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|SFR Yugoslavia]] when the first match between the two clubs was played. Although the first match was played in 1962 it was not until the independence of [[Slovenia]] from 1991 onwards when most of the matches were played. The main reason being the fact that both clubs were part of the Yugoslav football system and, during the period from 1960 (establishment of NK Maribor) until 1991 (establishment of Slovenian league, the [[Slovenian PrvaLiga]]), played only a total of ten seasons in the same league. The two clubs were one of only three Slovenian football clubs, the other being [[NK Nafta Lendava|Nafta Lendava]] for the 1946–47 season. Maribor played in the Yugoslav first league for a total of five seasons, between 1967–68 and 1971–72, with the best result of 10th place in 1969–70. Olimpija played in the Yugoslav first league for a total of twenty seasons, in 1953–54 and between 1965–66 and 1983–84, with the best result of 7th place in 1970–71 and 1982–1983 and five more top ten positions. Both clubs also played in the [[Yugoslav Cup]], where Maribor achieved its best result in 1973 and 1980 with reaching quarter-finals, while Olimpija was the Runner-up in the 1970 Cup.

===in Slovenia===
In 1991, after the declared independence of Slovenia, both clubs were the founding members of the Slovenian first league, 1.SNL, and played there up until the end of 2004-05 season and the dissolvement of NK Olimpija.&lt;ref name=&quot;oli_propad&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.zurnal24.si/nogomet/simic-stefanovic-posilja-groznje-ivan-simic-nzs-spins-dejan-stefanovic-odgovor-191033/clanek | title = Simič: &quot;Stefanović pošilja grožnje!&quot; | publisher = zurnal24.si | language = Slovene | accessdate = 6 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;sveza1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.football.si/Competitions|title=Competitions |  NZS|work=[[Football Association of Slovenia]] | accessdate=23 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two teams represented the two largest cities in Slovenia, the capital city of [[Ljubljana]] and the second largest city [[Maribor]], and both had one of the largest fanbases in the country. Traditionally Ljubljana represents the richer western part of the country while Maribor is the center of the poorer eastern part. In addition, Ljubljana was always the cultural, educational, economic and political center of the country and Olimpija and its fans were considered as the representatives of the [[upper class]]. Maribor, on the other hand, was one of the most industrialized cities in Yugoslavia and the majority of its fans were the representatives of the [[working class]], which means that the added tension to the rivalry was usually also political, social and cultural as well. However, this kind of division was much more apparent in the past, as the class differences between the fanbases have faded out and the social gap that once separated the two sides has closed over the years. Nowadays, both clubs boast fanbases that represent all the social classes. At the end of 2004 Olimpija Ljubljana was dissolved and, as the season was already in progress, was allowed to finish the rest of the 2004-05 season after which it effectively ceased all operations.&lt;ref name=&quot;oli_propad&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;sveza1&quot; /&gt; Until the dissolvement of Olimpija, both clubs were the most successful teams in Slovenian club football. From 1991 until 2005 Maribor and Olimpija had won a combined total of eleven out of fourteen Slovenian championships (Maribor 7, Olimpija 4), and nine out of fourteen [[Slovenian Football Cup|Slovenian cup]]s (Maribor 5, Olimpija 4).

The old rivalry reached its peak in the final round of the [[2000–01 Slovenian PrvaLiga|2000–01]] season, when one of the most celebrated matches in the [[Slovenian PrvaLiga|Slovenian League]] history was played, when Olimpija met Maribor at their home stadium, [[Bežigrad Stadium|Bežigrad]]. Both teams were competing for their 5th Slovenian league title. The home team needed a win for the title, while a draw was enough for Maribor. The atmosphere was electric days before the kick-off and the stadium with 8,500 seats was completely sold out. At the end, the match ended with a draw (1–1) and Maribor started to celebrate their 5th consecutive title&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.rtvslo.si/sport/na-danasnji-dan/mariborcani-za-bezigradom-slavili-naslov/112711 | title = Mariborčani za Bežigradom slavili naslov | publisher = rtvslo.si | language = Slovene | accessdate = 8 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; in front of 3,000 violet fans that gathered in [[Ljubljana]] that day.&lt;ref name = 2001-2010&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.nkmaribor.com/Zgodovina/2001-2010#9916 | title = Zgodovina: 2001-2010 | publisher = nkmaribor.com | language = Slovene | accessdate = 20 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 March 2005 a new club was established,&lt;ref name = rtvslo_2005&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.rtvslo.si/sport/nogomet/zeleno-beli-v-stirih-letih-iz-pete-v-prvo-ligo/128475 | title = Zeleno-beli v štirih letih iz pete v prvo ligo  | publisher = rtvslo.si | language = Slovene | accessdate = 6 February 2011|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5wT1MRVNS |archivedate = 2011-02-13|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= olimpija_zgodovina&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.nkolimpija.si/zgodovina | title = NK Olimpija Ljubljana - Zgodovina  | publisher = nkolimpija.si | language = Slovene | accessdate = 6 February 2011|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5wT1NGgn2 |archivedate = 2011-02-13|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; under the name [[NK Bežigrad]], retaining Olimpija's fans, colours and most of the youth team players. NK Bežigrad later changed its name twice. First to NK Olimpija Bežigrad and finally to [[NK Olimpija Ljubljana (2005)|NK Olimpija Ljubljana]]. Although the board of the newly established club and its fans see the team as the spiritual continuation of the old club, they are not regarded as the legal successors of the old NK Olimpija and are not entitled to claim the honours won by the defunct club.&lt;ref name=&quot;nzs&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.nzs.si/nzs/predstavitev-nzs/klubi | title = Klubi -&gt; Ljubljana | NZS|work=[[Football Association of Slovenia]] | language = Slovene | accessdate = 7 February 2011|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5wT1NqhpD |archivedate = 2011-02-13|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PrvaLiga_Olimpija&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.prvaliga.si/klubi/?id=832&amp;id_menu=111 | title = PrvaLiga: NK Olimpija  | publisher = prvaliga.si | language = Slovene | accessdate = 6 February 2011|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5wT1SYQvJ |archivedate = 2011-02-13|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Technically the new Olimpija could gain the right for honours and history of the old club if the current club board would follow the example of [[Italy|Italian]] sides, [[ACF Fiorentina|Fiorentina]] and [[S.S.C. Napoli|Napoli]], who after bankruptcy and dissolvement, both found a way and repaid the old debts. Although the crest of the new Olimpija holds a year 1911 in it, the current board of the new Olimpija does not give the impression that they are interested in such a move. The official website of the new club has a written statement where it is clearly stated that ''NK Olimpija Ljubljana was founded on 2 March 2005, under the name NK Bežigrad.&lt;ref name=&quot;olimpija_zgodovina&quot; /&gt;

However, because the new Olimpija is supported by most of the fans of the previous Olimpija, including their [[ultras]] group the [[Green Dragons]] who has a long standing rivalry with Maribor's own ultras group Viole Maribor, many see the matches between Maribor and the new club as the continuation of the rivalry and refer to it by the same name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.siol.net/sportal/nogomet/prva_liga/novice/2010/09/vse_o_tekmi_olimpija_maribor.aspx | title = Mariborčani osvojili tudi Stožice | publisher = SIOL.net | language = Slovene | accessdate = 17 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.nogomania.com/Slovenski-Nogomet/Ekipa/Olimpija/Novica/Razbita-Olimpija-razbite-Stozice.aspx | title = Razbita Olimpija, razbite Stožice | publisher = Nogomania | language = Slovene | accessdate = 17 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are many fans, either the ones from Maribor or the ones from Ljubljana, that does not share the same view and does not share similar beliefs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.rtvslo.si/sport/nogomet/prva-liga-si-2010-11/vrsic-dovolj-je-bilo-cakanja-doma/250023#comments | title = Vršič: Dovolj je bilo čakanja doma #Comments | publisher = RTVSLO.si | language = Slovene | accessdate = 13 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.siol.net/sportal/nogomet/prva_liga/novice/2011/03/vrsic_igramo_lepse_od_maribora.aspx | title = Vršič: Igramo lepše od Maribora #Comments | publisher = SIOL.net | language = Slovene | accessdate = 13 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://24ur.com/sport/nogomet/foto-delitev-tock-na-104-vecnem-derbiju.html#comment | title = FOTO: Delitev točk na 104. večnem derbiju #Comments | publisher = 24ur.com | language = Slovene | accessdate = 13 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; including part of the media.&lt;ref name=&quot;dolg700&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://web.vecer.com/portali/vecer/v1/default.asp?kaj=3&amp;id=2011060705652861|title=Kukavičjih sto let|date=7 June 2011|work=[[Večer (Slovenia)|Večer]]|author=Marjan Horvat|language=Slovene|accessdate=8 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://web.vecer.com/portali/vecer/v1/default.asp?kaj=3&amp;id=2011031605629472 | title = Novo in staro štetje | publisher = VEČER.com | language = Slovene | accessdate = 24 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The overall statistics are tracked separately by the [[Football Association of Slovenia]] and the Association of [[Slovenian PrvaLiga|1.

Statistically, Maribor is the more successful club either in the case of matches only from the period from 1962 to 2005 or the whole period from 1962 to present day.&lt;ref name = oli_mb&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.nkolimpija.com/?page=club&amp;id=13 | title = Večni derbiji z Mariborom | publisher = nkolimpija.com | language = Slovene | accessdate = 17 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maribor is also much more successful in case of the matches against [[NK Olimpija Ljubljana (2005)|NK Olimpija]], established in 2005 as NK Bežigrad.

==Fans==
[[File:NK Maribor - NK Olimpija, 2009-08-08.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Viole Maribor in a cup match 2009 against Olimpija]]
Besides the city of Maribor itself and the surrounding area NK Maribor also has a large fan base in the whole regions of [[Lower Styria|Štajerska]] and [[Slovenian Carinthia|Koroška]]. The club also draws significant number of supporters from northern [[Upper Carniola|Gorenjska]] and northeastern [[Lower Carniola|Dolenjska]] as well as the capital city of [[Ljubljana]] itself, due to a large number of students and workers from eastern part of the country. Olimpija on the other hand draws much of its fans from the central part of the country, the majority from the city of Ljubljana with the surrounding area of southern [[Upper Carniola|Gorenjska]] and northwestern [[Lower Carniola|Dolenjska]]. A significant fan base is also present in the region of [[Inner Carniola|Notranjska]]. Overall, the two clubs were always the most popular football clubs in the country.

Both, Maribor and Olimpija, always had support on their matches from [[ultras]] groups called Viole Maribor, supporting NK Maribor, and the Green Dragons who supported NK Olimpija. The two groups are the largest in the country and it is not uncommon that the matches between the two clubs were sometimes interrupted by violent clashes between the two groups or with the police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://24ur.com/novice/crna-kronika/foto-viole-so-se-steple-z-redarji.html | title = FOTO in VIDEO: Stožice: Škode za okoli 20.000 evrov | publisher = 24ur | language = Slovene | accessdate = 17 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On many occasions, before or after the matches, the fans of the two clubs would also meet up and fight on the streets. One of the worst incidents, in April 2010 after a match, resulted in a stabbing of a member of the Green Dragons who, with a group of friends, got into a fight with members of the Viole in Ljubljana's railway station.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.siol.net/sportal/nogomet/prva_liga/novice/2010/04/navijaci_obracunali_se_med_seboj.aspx | title = Po derbiju v Ljubljani zaboden navijač | publisher = SIOL.net | language = Slovene | accessdate = 17 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, to date, there has not been any fatalities in the country related to football violence. Fans of Olimpija traditionally occupy the northern stands of the stadiums, while Maribor fans are present on the southern stands.

He then retired, only to return to football couple of years later where he played for the new Olimpija Ljubljana, at the time still known by the name NK Bežigrad, in lower tiers of Slovenian football. Milanič on the other hand played in 1.SNL for both clubs and later joined the new NK Olimpija, at the time known by the name NK Bežigrad where he played less than a season and eventually finished his career.

The village was established in 1965 as a [[youth village]] named '''Hazon Yehezkel''' by a group called ''Mosadot Hinukh Ezuri'' (lit. ''Institute for Regional Education''), made up of young members of [[Agudat Israel]]. It was built on lands which had formerly belonged to the depopulated Arab village of [[Hatta, Gaza|Hatta]]. In 1996 the [[Ministry of Interior (Israel)|Ministry of Interior]] gave the village municipal council status and changed its name to Aluma.

The '''''Lives of the Most Excellent Italian Painters, Sculptors, and Architects, from Cimabue to Our Times''''', or ''Le Vite de' più eccellenti pittori, scultori, e architettori da Cimabue insino a' tempi nostri'', as it was originally known in Italian, is a series of artist biographies written by 16th century Italian painter and architect [[Giorgio Vasari]], which is considered &quot;perhaps the most famous, and even today the most-read work of the older literature of art&quot;,&lt;ref name=Gombrich&gt;[http://www.gombrich.co.uk/showdoc.php?id=18 Max Marmor, ''Kunstliteratur'', translated by [[Ernst Gombrich]], in Art Documentation Vol 11 # 1, 1992]&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;some of the Italian Renaissance's most influential writing on art&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;[http://webprod1.leeds.ac.uk/banner/dynmodules.asp?Y=200708&amp;M=ITAL-3223 University of Leeds website]&lt;/ref&gt; and &quot;the first important book on [[history of art|art history]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=mur&gt;Murray, P. and Murray, L. (1963) ''The art of the renaissance''. London: [[Thames &amp; Hudson]] (World of Art), p. 8. ISBN 978-0-500-20008-7&lt;/ref&gt; The title is often abridged to the ''Vite'' or the ''Lives''.

==Background==
As the first Italian art historian, Vasari initiated the genre of an encyclopedia of artistic biographies that continues today. Vasari's work was first published in 1550 by [[Lorenzo Torrentino]] in [[Florence]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://witcombe.sbc.edu/arth-technology/arth-technology2.html Christopher Witcombe, Art History and Technology]&lt;/ref&gt; and dedicated to Grand Duke [[Cosimo I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany|Cosimo I de' Medici]]. It included a valuable treatise on the technical methods employed in the arts. It was partly rewritten and enlarged in 1568 and provided with woodcut [[portraits]] of artists (some conjectural).     

The work has a consistent and notorious favour of Florentines and tends to attribute to them all the new developments in Renaissance art—for example, the invention of [[engraving]]. Venetian art in particular, let alone other parts of Europe, is systematically ignored.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sangensha.co.jp/allbooks/index/197E.htm Takuma Ito, Studies of Western Art No. 12, July 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; Between his first and second editions, Vasari visited Venice and the second edition gave more attention to Venetian art (finally including [[Titian]]) without achieving a neutral point of view. John Symonds claimed in 1899 that, &quot;It is clear that Vasari often wrote with carelessness, confusing dates and places, and taking no pains to verify the truth of his assertions&quot; (in regards to Vasari's life of Nicola [[Pisano]]), while acknowledging that, despite these shortcomings, it is one of the basic sources for information on the Renaissance in Italy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fullbooks.com/Renaissance-in-Italy-Vol-32.html John Addington Symonds, ''Renaissance in Italy,'' 1899, Vol. 3, Part 2]&lt;/ref&gt;

Vasari's biographies are interspersed with amusing gossip. Many of his anecdotes have the ring of truth, although likely inventions. Others are generic fictions, such as the tale of young [[Giotto]] painting a fly on the surface of a painting by [[Cimabue]] that the older master repeatedly tried to brush away, a genre tale that echoes anecdotes told of the Greek painter [[Apelles]]. He did not research archives for exact dates, as modern art historians do, and naturally his biographies are most dependable for the painters of his own generation and the immediately preceding one. Modern criticism—with all the new materials opened up by research—has corrected many of his traditional dates and attributions. The work is widely considered a classic even today, though it is widely agreed that it must be supplemented by modern critical research.

Vasari includes a forty-two-page sketch of his own biography at the end of his ''Vite'', and adds further details about himself and his family in his lives of Lazzaro Vasari and [[Francesco de' Rossi (Il Salviati)|Francesco Salviati]].

==Influence==
Vasari's ''Vite'' has been described as &quot;by far the most influential single text for the history of Renaissance art&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://warburg.sas.ac.uk/graduate_studies/synopses.htm Professor Hope, The [[Warburg Institute]], course synopsis, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; and &quot;the most important work of Renaissance biography of artists&quot;.&lt;ref name=Gombrich/&gt; Its influence is situated mainly in three domains: as an example for contemporary and later biographers and art historians, as a defining factor in the view on the Renaissance and the role of Florence and Rome in it, and as a major source of information on the lives and works of early Italian artists. 

The ''Vite'' have been translated wholly or partially into many languages, including English, Dutch, German, Spanish, French and Russian.

===Early translations became a model for others===
The ''Vite'' formed a model for encyclopedias of artist biographies. Different 17th century translators became artist biographers in their own country of origin and were often called the ''Vasari'' of their country. [[Karel Van Mander]] was probably the first Vasarian author with his ''Painting book'' (''Het Schilderboeck'', 1604), which encompassed not only the first Dutch translation of Vasari, but also the first Dutch translation of Ovid and was accompanied by a list of Italian painters who appeared on the scene after Vasari, and the first comprehensive list of biographies of painters from the [[Low Countries]].&lt;ref name=Gombrich/&gt; Similarly, [[Joachim von Sandrart]], author of  ''Deutsche Akademie'' (1675), became known as the &quot;German Vasari&quot; and Antonio Palomino, author of &quot;[[An account of the lives and works of the most eminent Spanish painters, sculptors and architects]]&quot; (1724), became the &quot;Spanish Vasari&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://muse.jhu.edu/login?uri=/journals/the_library_the_transactions_of_the_bibliographical_society/v007/7.4meurer.html Abstract from the transactions of the bibliographical society]&lt;/ref&gt; In England, [[William Aglionby|Aglionby]]'s ''Painting Illustrated'' from 1685 was largely based on Vasari as well.&lt;ref name=Gombrich/&gt;

===View of the Renaissance===
The ''Vite'' is also important as the basis for discussions about the development of style.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.cgi?path=302111100893994 Elinor Richter, reviewing Philip Sohms study of style in the art theory] :&quot;Giorgio Vasari's Vite, the first edition of which was published in 1550, provides the foundation for any discussion of the development of style.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; It influenced the view art historians had of the Early Renaissance for a long time, placing too much emphasis on the achievements of Florentine and Roman artists while ignoring those of the rest of Italy and certainly the artists from the rest of Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://muse.jhu.edu/demo/renaissance_quarterly/v060/60.1leone.html Stephanie Leone, The Renaissance Society of Americ, 2007]: &quot;[...] the traditional definition of Renaissance art as the humanistic innovations of Florentine and Roman artists, to which Giorgio Vasari's Vite (1550, 1568) gave rise.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Source of information===
Finally, it has also been for centuries the most important source of information on [[Early Renaissance]] Italian (and especially [[Tuscany|Tuscan]]) painters and the attribution of their paintings. In 1899, [[John Addington Symonds]] used the ''Vite'' as one of his basic sources for the description of artists in his seven books on the ''Renaissance in Italy'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/11559/11559-h/11559-h.htm Full text of John Symonds' &quot;Renaissance in Italy&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; and nowadays it is still, despite its obvious biases and shortcomings, the basis for the biographies of many artists like [[Leonardo da Vinci]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lib.rochester.edu/index.cfm?PAGE=3456 Bernard Barryte, The life of Leonardo da Vinci, University of Rochester Library Bulletin (1984)]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contents ==
The ''Vite'' contains the biographies of many important Italian artists, and is also adopted as a sort of classical reference guide for their names, which are sometimes used in different ways. The following list respects the order of the book, as divided into its three parts. The book starts with a dedication to [[Cosimo I de' Medici]] and a preface, and then starts with technical and background texts about architecture, sculpture, and painting. A second preface follows, introducing the actual &quot;Vite&quot; in parts 2 to 5. What follows is the complete list from the second (1568) edition. In a few cases, different very short biographies were given in one section.

'''Slater &amp; Gordon''' is an [[Australia]]n [[law firm]] employing over 1,000 people across Australia. It was founded in [[Melbourne]], [[Victoria, Australia|Victoria]] in 1935 by a Barrister and Solicitor from Irymple in country Victoria, Hugh Lyons Gordon and Labor politician [[Bill Slater (politician)|William Slater]]. 

Slater &amp; Gordon’s practice areas include: [[asbestos]] diseases [[litigation]], [[workers compensation]], [[motor vehicle accident]] [[Damages|compensation]], [[medical negligence]], [[public liability]] litigation, [[Commonwealth]] compensation (Comcare), industrial relations and employment law, wills probate and estate litigation, business advisory services and commercial litigation.  The firm also conducts [[class action]]s, typically product liability actions or commercial actions on behalf of [[investors]] who have suffered financial loss.

==Founders==
=== Bill Slater===
{{main|Bill Slater (politician)}}

===Hugh Gordon===
Hugh Lyons Gordon was a Barrister and Solicitor from Irymple in country Victoria, who, in 1935, along with his brother-in-law, Bill Slater, founded the law firm Slater &amp; Gordon.

In September 1941, during [[World War 2]] whilst in Melbourne, Gordon enlisted in the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF). After training as an Observor, he became a [[Flying Officer]] (Navigator). He was sent to England where he was subsequently posted to [[No. 460 Squadron RAAF|460 (Australian) Squadron]] who by this time were flying the [[Avro Lancaster]] bomber. 

Gordon was killed on June 15, 1943&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.awm.gov.au/collection/records/roh_raaf/crews/460/roh_raaf-crews-460-67ad.pdf|title=460 SQUADRON RAAF, WORLD WAR 2 FATALITIES – 15 June 1943 |publisher=Australian War Memorial|date=|accessdate=Feb 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;CWGC Gordon&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cwgc.org/find-war-dead/casualty/2645531/GORDON,%20HUGH%20LYONS|title=Casualty details: GORDON, HUGH LYONS|publisher=Commonwealth War Graves Commission|date=|accessdate=Feb 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; when the Lancaster he crewed was shot down, along with 21 other planes, by ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' [[flying ace]] [[Manfred Meurer]] and his fighter wing.&lt;ref&gt;http://books.google.com.au/books/about/The_Bomber_Command_war_diaries.html?id=Y0MpAQAAMAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y&lt;/ref&gt; Two men escaped the crash to become POW's; the remaining five, including Gordon, are buried in Jonkerbos War Cemetery, Gelderland, Nijmegen, Netherlands.&lt;ref name=&quot;CWGC Gordon&quot;/&gt; Gordon was 34 years old when he was killed.&lt;ref name=&quot;CWGC Gordon&quot;/&gt;

==Legal Representation==
Over the years Slater &amp; Gordon has handled some of the most complex and widely publicised cases in Australia. These include representing hundreds of asbestos miners at the [[Wittenoom, Western Australia|Wittenoom]] mine in [[Western Australia]]. In 2000, the company lodged a writ in the [[Victorian Supreme Court]] against [[BHP Billiton|Broken Hill Proprietary Company (BHP)]] on behalf of traditional owners in [[Papua New Guinea]] over the collapse of a tailings dam led to waste from the [[Ok Tedi Mine]] polluting the [[Ok Tedi]] and [[Fly River]]s in 1984.  Other cases are representing victims of medically acquired [[HIV]] from contaminated blood supplies; and women suffering health problems due to faulty [[IUD]]s and [[breast implant]]s.

In December 2005, the firm negotiated a settlement with [[James Hardie]] worth $4.5 billion on behalf of unions and people suffering from [[asbestosis]], [[mesothelioma]] and other asbestos-related diseases as a result of exposure to asbestos while working for the company.

==Acquisitions and Mergers==
The firm has completed acquisitions of a number of other law firms - Reid &amp; Reid Solicitors, Maurice May Lawyers, Gary Robb &amp; Associates, Geoffrey Edwards &amp; Co, Paul Keady &amp; Associates, Blessington Judd and Richards Lawyers in 2003. More recently Slater &amp; Gordon has merged with D'Arcys Solicitors, McClellands Lawyers, Secombs Solicitors, John Micallef &amp; Co, McGlades Personal Injury Law, Long Howland Lawyers, Kenyons Lawyers, Stewart &amp; Noble Lawyers, Adams Leyland Lawyers, Conveyancing Works (QLD), Bussoletti (Wollongong), Trilby Misso Lawyers &amp; Keddies Lawyers.

==Former status==

===County===
The county of West Lothian was called '''Linlithgowshire''' or the '''County of Linlithgow''' until 1921.

Before it was abolished in 1975 by the [[Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973]], the county contained six [[burgh]]s. Two are now outside the West Lothian unitary council area:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Burgh
! Unitary council area
|-
| [[Armadale, West Lothian|Armadale]]
|rowspan=4| West Lothian
|-
| [[Bathgate]]
|-

|-
| [[Whitburn, West Lothian|Whitburn]]
|-
| [[Bo'ness]]
| [[Falkirk (council area)|Falkirk]]
|-
| [[South Queensferry]]
| [[City of Edinburgh]]
|}

On abolition in 1975 the county, with the exception of the Bo'ness area, was included in the [[Lothian Region]]. Bo'ness became part of the [[Central Region, Scotland|Central Region]]. Lothian Region was divided into four districts, one of which was named West Lothian and approximated to the former county.

===District===
West Lothian District was created in 1975, comprising the [[Counties of Scotland|county]] of West Lothian; less the [[burgh]]s of [[Bo'ness]] and [[South Queensferry]] and the [[Kirkliston]] area; it also included the East Calder and West Calder districts of the former [[county of Midlothian]]. The council's headquarters were originally in Bathgate, later moving to the [[New towns in the United Kingdom|new town]] of Livingston. The unitary authority created in 1996 used the same boundaries.

===Areas of West Lothian===

==Mentions in popular culture==
The [[West Lothian question]] is often said to have been raised by [[Tam Dalyell]], then member of [[British House of Commons|Parliament]] for the former [[West Lothian (UK Parliament constituency)|West Lothian constituency]], in his 1977 book ''[[Devolution]]: The End of Britain?'' However, in the debate on the Referendum (English Parliament) Bill (HC Deb 16 January 1998 vol 304 cc589-660) Dalyell refers to the &quot;so-called West Lothian question, as it was dubbed by [[Enoch Powell]], not by me, in 1977&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1998/jan/16/referendum-english-parliament-bill#S6CV0304P0_19980116_HOC_77 |title=Referendum (English Parliament) Bill (Hansard, 16 January 1998) |publisher=Hansard.millbanksystems.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; denying this.

'''Sufutun''' ({{lang-zh|蘇埠屯}}) is the largest [[Shang dynasty]] archaeological site outside [[Yinxu|Anyang]] presently known, situated in [[Qingzhou]] municipality, Shandong. 

Occasional finds by Yidu farmers were reported in 1931; in 1965-6 a chariot burial and four tombs have been excavated, followed by 6 more tombs in 1986. Though the tombs were robbed, and site itself damaged by road construction, it still yielded a large amount of important finds. Some of the artifacts bear an emblem of ''Ya Chou'', possibly a clan name.

Archaeological evidence allows conclusion that the site is directly related to the Shang capital Yin, situated 400 km to the west. It is rather a colony than the local culture development.

&quot;'''Spaceman'''&quot; is a song by [[United Kingdom|British]] singer-songwriter [[Jas Mann]], of [[Babylon Zoo]]. Known for its heavily distorted guitars and metallic, robotic-sounding vocals, it went straight to Number 1 on the UK singles chart on 21 January 1996, selling 418,000 copies in the first week of release. At the time it was the fastest selling single by a debut artist in the UK.

==Song history==
Promotional copies of &quot;Spaceman&quot; had been distributed, and the [[Arthur Baker (musician)|Arthur Baker]] remix was chosen to tie in with the release on 1 December 1995 of a new [[Levi's]] jeans [[Television|TV]] [[advertisement|advert]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Alex P. |last=King |title=Hit-parade — 20 ans de tubes |publisher=Pascal |year=2004 |place=Paris |page=347 |language=French |isbn=2-35019-009-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; titled &quot;[http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=g5TXolwA7cE Planet]&quot; which was directed by Vaughan Arnell and [[Anthea Benton]]. The advertisement concentrated on the speeded-up vocal section at the beginning and end of the song, which was the product of an Arthur Baker remix. The single went straight to Number 1 on the [[UK singles chart]] on 21 January 1996, selling 418,000 copies in the first week of release, at the time being the fastest selling single by a debut artist in the [[United Kingdom|UK]]. The single remained at number 1 in the UK for 5 weeks, selling 893,000 copies in this period. The single also went to Number 1 in the single charts in twenty-three countries.

On the promotional version of &quot;Spaceman&quot; there are extra lyrics at the start of the song, with Jas saying &quot;I killed your mother, I killed your sister&quot; and then later &quot;I killed you all&quot;. These lyrics were later taken out of the song and replaced with the Arthur Baker introduction; although, the &quot;I killed you all&quot; lyric is still buried in the song (it can be heard after the first chorus). There was a lower budget video made for this version.

In 2006 &quot;Spaceman&quot; featured on trailers for [[Ant and Dec]]'s film ''[[Alien Autopsy]]'', the [[BBC]]'s children's channel, [[CBeebies]] for the animated pre-school series ''[[Lunar Jim]]'', and [[Network Ten]]'s advertisement for ''[[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)|Battlestar Galactica]]''. &quot;Spaceman&quot; is also used in ''[[Eesti otsib superstaari]]'' (Pop Idol Estonia).  &quot;Spaceman&quot; is also featured in E4's [[My Mad Fat Diary]] in the episode &quot;Ladies and Gentlemen&quot; during the scene where Rae and Finn begin their drive to Knebworth.

==Cover versions==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4707">The '''Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution''' is a [[Ministry (government department)|government ministry]] of [[India]]. The Ministry is headed by a [[Minister (government)|minister]] of [[Council of Ministers of the Republic of India|Cabinet rank]]. The current [[Minister of state]] with independent charge is [[K.V. Thomas]].&lt;ref&gt;http://india.gov.in/outerwin.php?id=http://fcamin.nic.in/&lt;/ref&gt; 

The ministry is divided into two departments,  the '''Department of Food and Public Distribution''' and the '''Department of Consumer Affairs''' .

==Department of Food and Public Distribution==

The objectives of the Department are to ensure 
*The remunerative rates for the farmers 
*Supply of food grains at reasonable prices to the consumers through the public distribution system.

===Public Distribution System===
The Indian '''[[Public Distribution System]]''' ('''PDS''') is a national [[food security]] system that distributed [[Subsidy|subsidized]] food to [[Poverty in India|India's poor]]. Major commodities distributed include [[wheat]], [[rice]], [[sugar]], and [[kerosene]]. Surpluses of food from increased [[crop yield]]s (as a result of the [[Green Revolution]] and good [[monsoon]] seasons) are managed by the [[Food Corporation of India]], established by the Food Corporation Act 1964, implements national policy for farm [[price support]], operations, procurement, storage, preservation, inter-state movement and distribution operations. PDS has a network of about 478,000 Fair Price Shops (FPS), perhaps the largest distribution network of its type in the world, operated by the [[Government of India|Union Government]] and state governments.

==Department of Consumer Affairs==

The Department of Consumer affairs administers the policies for Consumer Cooperatives, Monitoring Prices, availability of essential commodities, Consumer Movement in the country and Controlling of statutory bodies like [[Bureau of Indian Standards]](BIS) and Weights and Measures.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dept of Consumer Affairs - Overview&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Dept of Consumer Affairs - Overview|url=http://consumeraffairs.nic.in/consumer/?q=node/3|publisher=Dept of Consumer Affairs|accessdate=4 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The department is responsible for following:&lt;ref name=&quot;Dept of Consumer Affairs - Overview&quot;/&gt;

*Standards of Weights and Measures
*The [[Bureau of Indian Standards]]
*Consumer Cooperatives
*Forward Markets Commission, Mumbai.
*Monitoring of Prices and Availability of essential commodities
*The [[Consumer Protection Act, 1986]]
*Consumer Welfare Fund
* Internal Trade
* Inter-State Trade: The Spirituous Preparations (Inter-State Trade and Commerce) Control Act, 1955 (39 of 1955).
* Control of Futures Trading: the Forward Contracts (Regulations) Act, 1952 (74 of 1952).

The department of that are considered essential,regulates the availability and takes measures thereof along with prescribing measures to see that the whole system works towards the food security of vulnerable a lot of motivation,provided waves of zeal to owners of shops to make them into mini mall type structures that could perforce supply the maximum choice of goods&amp;services to population to be reached including  beneficiaries  in their allotted areas.This has also given them more of dignity,accountability,visibility, positive orientation and  changed mind set to do well,improve upon their perceived image as one who indulged in  diversion,pilferage or leakages that rocked from within, just  for his own ends only. This precisely had been the guiding factor to go for a systemic change in the scope of activity &amp;goods handling,that has been liked by other states and also drawn the attention of a set of young MPs who had been given a presentation on the same.

==Organizations==
The [[Public Sector Undertaking]] (PSU)s under the administrative control of Dept. of Public Distribution are:

* [[Food Corporation of India]] (FCI)
* [[Central Warehousing Corporation]] (CWC)

&lt;/ref&gt; and village in [[Yukon-Koyukuk Census Area, Alaska]], United States. At the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]] the population was 190.&lt;ref name=&quot;2010 Census&quot;/&gt;

== History ==
Kaltag was a Koyokon [[Athabascan]] area used as a cemetery for surrounding villages. It is located on an old portage trail which led west through the mountains to [[Unalakleet, Alaska|Unalakleet]]. The Athabascans had seasonal camps in the area and moved as the wild game migrated. There were 12 summer fish camps located on the [[Yukon River]] between the [[Koyukuk River]] and the [[Nowitna River]].

Kaltag was named by Russians for the Koyokon man named Kaltaga.

There was a smallpox epidemic in 1839 that killed a large part of the population of the area.

After the Alaska Purchase, a United States military telegraph line was constructed along the north side of the Yukon River. A trading post opened around 1880, just before the gold rush of 1884-85. Steamboats on the Yukon, which supplied gold prospectors ran before and after 1900 with 46 boats in operation on the river in the peak year of 1900. A measles epidemic and food shortages during 1900 reduced the population of the area by one-third. The village Kaltag was established after the epidemic when survivors from three nearby villages moved to the area. 

There was a minor gold rush in the area in the 1880s. In 1906, gold seekers left for [[Fairbanks, Alaska|Fairbanks]] or [[Nome, Alaska|Nome]]; however, the Galena lead mines began operating in 1919. Kaltag was downriver from the mines and grew as a point on the transportation route for the mines. It declined in the 1940s as mining declined.

The old cemetery caved into the river around 1937. An airport and clinic were constructed during the 1960s.

Kaltag has a week long Stick Dance Festival every two years that draws visitors from many neighboring villages. This festival is sponsored by relatives of the recently deceased, in appreciation of those who helped during their time of mourning.

Much of the economy around Kaltag is based on subsistence hunting and fishing. Salmon, whitefish, moose, bear, waterfowl and berries are elements of the subsistence economy.

==Geography==
Kaltag is located at {{Coord|64|19|31|N|158|43|37|W|type:city}} (64.325145, -158.727030).{{GR|1|dateform=mdy}}

'''Atomic demolition munitions''' (ADMs), colloquially known as nuclear land mines, are small [[nuclear explosive device]]s. ADMs were developed for both military and civilian purposes. As weapons, they were designed to be exploded in the forward battle area, in order to block or channel enemy forces. Non-militarily, they were designed for demolition, mining or earthmoving. However, apart from testing, they have never been used for either purpose.

==Military uses==
Instead of being delivered to the target by missiles, rockets, or artillery shells, ADMs were intended to be emplaced by soldiers. Due to their relatively small size and light weight, ADMs could be emplaced by military engineers or [[Special Forces]] teams, then detonated on command or by timer to create massive obstructions. By destroying key terrain features or choke points such as bridges, dams, mountain passes and tunnels, ADMs could block the movement of enemy forces or channel them into prepared [[killing zone]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | type = field manual | id = 5-106 | title = Employment of Atomic Demolition Munitions | place = [[Washington, DC]], [[United States of America|US]] | publisher = Department of the Army | month = July | year = 1984}} (unclassified).&lt;/ref&gt;

According to official accounts, the [[United States]] deployed ADMs overseas in [[Italy]] and [[West Germany]] during the [[Cold War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Kenneth W | last = Condit | title = The History of the Joint Chiefs of Staff—The Joint Chiefs of Staff and National Policy | volume = VI, 1955–56 | place = Washington, DC, US | publisher = GPO | year = 1992 | page = 146}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | publisher = 93rd Congress | title = US Security Issues in Europe | date = December 2, 1973 | page = 15}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | newspaper = The New York Times | date = December 2, 1973 | pages = 1, 34}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Recent scholarship also indicates that the most modern types (SADM and MADM) were deployed in [[South Korea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Peter | last = Hayes | url = http://www.nautilus.org/DPRKBriefingBook/nuclearweapons/PacificPowderkegbyPeterHayes.pdf | title = Pacific Powderkeg: American Nuclear Dilemmas in Korea | place = Lexington, [[Massachusetts]], US | publisher = DC Heath and Co | year = 1991 | page = 48}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Thomas ‘Tom’ | last = Gervasi | title = The Myth of Soviet Nuclear Supremacy | place = [[New York]], US | publisher = Harper &amp; Row | year = 1986 | pages = 416–7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first1 = William M | last1 = Arkin | first2 = Richard W | last2 = Fieldhouse | title = Nuclear Battlefields: Global Links in the Arms Race | place = Cambridge | publisher = Ballinger | year = 1985 | page = 61}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Civilian uses==
ADMs have never been used commercially, although such devices have been used to put out gas-well fires as part of the Soviet test program.

The [[Soviet Union]] tested the use of nuclear devices for mining and natural gas extraction on several occasions starting in the mid-1960s, as part of the [[Nuclear Explosions for the National Economy]] program. Tests for similar purposes were carried out in the [[United States]] under [[Operation Plowshare]], but due to radioactive contamination caused by the tests, no commercial use was made of the technology. With today's greater concerns over the dangers of radiation, it seems unlikely that nuclear explosives will ever be used for non-military purposes.

==United States ADMs==
In the 1950s and 1960s, the United States developed several different types of lightweight nuclear devices. The main one was the [[W54]], a cylinder 40 by 60&amp;nbsp;cm (about 16 by 24 inches) that weighed 68&amp;nbsp;kg (150&amp;nbsp;lbs). It was fired by a mechanical timer and had a [[variable yield]] equivalent to between 10&amp;nbsp;tons and 1 [[kiloton|kt]] of TNT.  The W54 nuclear device was used in the [[Davy Crockett (nuclear device)|Davy Crockett Weapon System]].

===TADM===
The Mk 30 Mod 1 ''[[Tactical Atomic Demolition Munition]]'' (TADM) was a portable [[atomic bomb]], consisting of a [[W30|Mk 30]] warhead installed in a X-113 case. The X-113 was 26&amp;nbsp;inches (66&amp;nbsp;cm) in diameter and 70 [[inches|in]] (178&amp;nbsp;cm) long, and looked like corrugated culvert pipe. The whole system weighed 840 pounds (381&amp;nbsp;kg). Production of the TADM started in 1961 and all were removed from stockpile by 1966. A weapons effect test of the TADM was made in the Johnny Boy shot of the [[Operation Dominic I and II|Dominic II series]]. The yield of Johnny Boy was .5 kt.

===SADM===
The ''[[Special Atomic Demolition Munition]] (SADM)'' was a family of man-portable [[nuclear weapon]]s fielded by the US military in the 1960s, but never used in actual combat.  The US Army planned to use the weapons in Europe in the event of a Soviet invasion.  US Army Engineers would use the weapon to irradiate, destroy, and deny key routes of communication through limited terrain such as the [[Fulda Gap]].  Troops were trained to [[parachute]] into Soviet occupied western Europe with the SADM and destroy power plants, bridges, and dams.  

The weapon was designed to allow one person to parachute from any type of aircraft carrying the weapon package and place it in a harbor or other strategic location that could be accessed from the sea. Another parachutist without a weapon package would follow the first to provide support as needed.

The two-person team would place the weapon package in the target location, set the timer, and swim out into the ocean where they would be retrieved by a [[submarine]] or a high-speed surface water craft.

===MADM===

The ''[[Medium Atomic Demolition Munition]]'' (MADM) was a tactical nuclear weapon developed by the United States during the Cold War. They were designed to be used as nuclear land mines and for other tactical purposes, with a relatively low [[nuclear weapon yield|explosive yield]] from a [[W45]] warhead, between 1 and 15 [[kiloton]]s. Each MADM weighted around 400&amp;nbsp;lb (181&amp;nbsp;kg) total.  They were produced between 1965 and 1986.{{Citation needed | date = February 2008}}

'''Varjojen Kirja''' ('''Varjojenkirja.com''') is an online information and society networking site for the [[Finland|Finnish]] pagan ([[Paganism]]) community. It is a [[non-profit organization]] run by married couple Unenkulkija and Karhuntassu and has been operated since late 2004.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.varjojenkirja.com/veekoo.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally released as an online library for [[herb]]s, [[charmstone]]s, [[witchcraft]] [[rite]]s and [[horoscope]]s, it soon gained popularity among Finnish pagans. Most of the site content is [[wiki|wiki-styled]] user-editable which has enabled the site to expand its content 5 to 10 times from the original content.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.varjojenkirja.com/tietoa.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Popularity ==

Site receives over 300.000 page loads per month making it one of the most popular and best-known Finnish pagan sites.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.varjojenkirja.com/mediatiedot.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.submitexpress.com/cgi-bin/linkpoptest/popular.pl?url1=www.varjojenkirja.com&amp;url2=www.wicca.fi&amp;url3=www.pakanaverkko.fi&amp;email=&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Google]] along there 128.000 hits which is mostly because of the large article content.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.google.com/#hl=en&amp;source=hp&amp;q=varjojenkirja.com&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the site visitors are non-registered users which find the site from search engines, although site has active userbase of nearly 2000 user registration since 2004. Currently there are nearly 500 active users of which site receives 100 to 200 logins per date.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.varjojenkirja.com/noitapiiri.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.varjojenkirja.com/tilastot.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Site has been cited in many Finnish print-medias and sites as an information source for horoscope, witchcraft and it is one of the most quoted Finnish pagan sites online. Due the popularity of the content there has been several copyright-issues between site-owners and the third party site owners who have copied the content without referencing to the original. This has led to [[Cease and desist]] styled contacts to the content copiers from the owners and original authors of the articles.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.varjojenkirja.com/copyright.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Content ==

When started in 2004 site contained 200 - 300 different [[Article (publishing)|articles]],&lt;ref&gt;http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.varjojenkirja.com&lt;/ref&gt; a number which has steadily increased thank to user-contribution driven content of the site. Originally most of the articles concentrated on Wicca as a pagan religion, but later specially in summer 2009 main articles were fully rewritten and changed to aim most known natural-based belief-systems currently active in Finland. Site contains nowadays almost 2000 different articles of the paganism, witchcraft and different kind of religions. Site also has quite large discussion board and active online society.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.varjojenkirja.com/veekoo.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2006 copyright of the content was changed to a  [[Creative Commons]], but due major update of the site in summer 2009 all newly-written content on the site have been partially copyrighted. Content is said to be free to use for personal use and also for third party websites as long as source is mentioned in the form of the quote.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.varjojenkirja.com/copyright.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversies ==

During its operating years there has been several controversies. Most of these has been caused by the site's user-verification policy which demands registering users to identify themselves by using [[SMS]] verification. Users name and [[Address geography|address]] must be recognizable from the [[Directory assistance|phone records]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.varjojenkirja.com/rekisterointi.html&lt;/ref&gt; As this is unlike most of registration demands the online pagan resources, it has started a [[Flaming (Internet)|flame wars]] on the hundreds of other more open-access Finnish [[Virtual community|internet communities]].

The method of registration has changed several times during operating years, although SMS identification has always been mandatory. During years 2005-2007 identifying using phone records was not mandatory and identity confirmation was done by requiring HETU ([[National identification number]]) but this was ended by the complaints to the National Data Protection Supervisor. Finnish law permits HETU inquiring only in the case of credit services.&lt;ref&gt;http://web.archive.org/web/20071016043104/http://www.varjojenkirja.com&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006 site was under police investigation because of the [[Denial-of-service attack]] was made against site using vulnerability in the registration verification system by a Finnish individual.

Site has faced also has several legal-threats and accusations of [[defamation]], user-removal and content-based charges but Almost all of these have made users removed from the site by [[misbehavior]] or [[Troll (Internet)|trolling]]. No charge has ever raised against site or against it owners.&lt;ref&gt;Online interview of the administrators, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Nebraska''''' is the sixth studio album by [[Bruce Springsteen]], released in [[1982 in music|1982]] on [[Columbia Records]].

Sparsely-recorded on a cassette-tape [[Portastudio]], the tracks on ''Nebraska'' were originally intended as [[demo (music)|demos]] of songs to be recorded with the [[E Street Band]]. However, Springsteen ultimately decided to release the demos themselves. ''Nebraska'' remains one of the most highly-regarded albums in his catalogue. The songs on ''Nebraska'' deal with ordinary, blue collar characters who face a challenge or a turning point in their lives. Unlike his previous albums, very little salvation and grace is present within the songs.

==History==
Initially, Springsteen recorded demos for the album at his home with a [[4-track (multitrack)|4-track]] [[compact audio cassette|cassette]] recorder. The demos were sparse, using only [[Steel-string guitar|acoustic guitar]], [[electric guitar]] (on &quot;Open All Night&quot;), [[harmonica]], [[mandolin]], [[glockenspiel]], [[tambourine]], [[organ (music)|organ]] and Springsteen's [[vocals|voice]].

Springsteen then recorded the album in a studio with the [[E Street Band]]. However, he and the producers and engineers working with him felt that a raw, haunted [[folk music|folk]] essence present on the home tapes was lacking in the band treatments, and so they ultimately decided to release the demo version as the final album.  Complications with mastering of the tapes ensued because of low recording volume, but the problem was overcome with sophisticated noise reduction techniques.

Springsteen fans have long speculated whether Springsteen's full-band recording of the album, nicknamed ''Electric Nebraska'', will ever surface. In a 2006 interview, manager [[Jon Landau]] said it was unlikely and that &quot;the right version of ''Nebraska'' came out&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.therockradio.com/2006/07/springsteen-looking-at-archival.html The Rock Radio: Springsteen looking at archival releases&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  But in a 2010 interview with ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', E Street Band drummer [[Max Weinberg]] praised the full band recording of the album as &quot;killing.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/17386/113564 Max Weinberg on His Future With Conan and Bruce | Music News | Rolling Stone&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  Somewhat different band arrangements of most of these songs were heard on the 1984-1985 [[Born in the U.S.A. Tour]] and have been played in various guises ever since.

Other songs demoed during the ''Nebraska'' sessions include &quot;[[Born in the U.S.A. (song)|Born in the U.S.A.]],&quot; &quot;[[Downbound Train]],&quot; &quot;Child Bride&quot; (which later evolved into &quot;[[Working on the Highway]]&quot;), &quot;[[Pink Cadillac (song)|Pink Cadillac]]&quot;, &quot;The Big Payback&quot;, &quot;Johnny Bye Bye&quot;, and &quot;Losin' Kind&quot; . Some have leaked on bootlegs.
{{Quote box|width=350px|align=right|quote= &quot;I was just doing songs for the next rock album, and I decided that what always took me so long in the studio was the writing. I would get in there, and I just wouldn't have the material ''written'', or it wasn't written well enough, and so I'd record for a month, get a couple of things, go home write some more, record for another month — it wasn't very efficient. So this time, I got a little [[Teac]] four-track cassette machine, and I said, I'm gonna record these songs, and if they sound good with just me doin' 'em, then I'll teach 'em to the band. I could sing and play the guitar, and then I had two tracks to do somethin' else, like overdub a guitar or add a harmony. It was just gonna be a demo. Then I had a little [[Echoplex]] that I mixed through, and that was it. And that was the tape that became the record. It's amazing that it got there, 'cause I was carryin' that cassette around with me in my pocket without a case for a couple of week, just draggin' it around. Finally, we realized, &quot;Uh-oh, that's the album.&quot; Technically, it was difficult to get it on a disc. The stuff was recorded so strangely, the needle would read a lot of distortion and wouldn't track in the wax. We almost had to release it as a cassette.&quot;|source=–&lt;small&gt;[[Bruce Springsteen]], recalling the early stages of the recording of the album, Rolling Stone Interview, December 1984&lt;ref name=&quot;rsinterview&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/news/coverstory/5933449/page/|title=The Rolling Stone Interview: Bruce Springsteen|author=Kurt Loder|date=December 6, 1984|accessdate=December 30, 2009}} {{Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|3}}&lt;/small&gt;

==Themes==
The album begins with &quot;[[Nebraska (song)|Nebraska]]&quot;, a [[first-person narrative]] based on the true story of 19-year-old [[spree killer]] [[Charles Starkweather]] and his 14-year-old girlfriend, [[Caril Ann Fugate]], and ends with &quot;Reason to Believe&quot;, a complex narrative that renders its title phrase into contemptuous sarcasm. The remaining songs are largely of the same bleak tone, including the dark &quot;State Trooper,&quot; influenced by [[Suicide (band)|Suicide]]'s &quot;[[Frankie Teardrop]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Allmusic|class=song|id=t256857|pure_url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Criminal behavior continues as a theme in the song &quot;[[Highway Patrolman]]&quot;: even though the protagonist works for the law, he lets his brother escape after he has shot someone (this became the basis for the [[Sean Penn]]-directed film ''[[The Indian Runner]]'').  &quot;[[Open All Night (song)|Open All Night]]&quot;, a [[Chuck Berry]]-style lone guitar rave-up, does manage a dose of defiant, humming-towards-the-gallows exuberance.

Springsteen stated that the stories in this album were partly inspired by historian [[Howard Zinn]]'s book ''[[A People's History of the United States]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/28/us/28zinn.html The New York Times - Howard Zinn, Historian, Dies at 87] &quot;...Bruce Springsteen said the starkest of his many albums, &quot;Nebraska,&quot; drew inspiration in part from Mr. Zinn's writings.&quot; Retrieved April 29, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[music video]] was produced for the song &quot;[[Atlantic City (song)|Atlantic City]]&quot;; it features stark, black-and-white images of the city, which had not yet undergone its later economic transformation.  &quot;Atlantic City&quot; was released as a single in the [[UK]], but not the U.S.

==Homage==
Country music icon [[Johnny Cash]]'s 1983 album ''[[Johnny 99]]'' featured versions of two of Springsteen's songs from ''Nebraska'': &quot;Johnny 99&quot; and &quot;Highway Patrolman&quot;. Also the title of the track &quot;Mansion on the Hill&quot; is derived from the lyrics of [[Van Morrison]]'s &quot;[[Cyprus Avenue]]&quot;.

&quot;Mansion on the Hill&quot; was in 2008 covered by the American indie rock group [[The National (band)|The National]] on its ''[[The Virginia EP|Virginia EP]]''.

[[Emmylou Harris]] covered the song &quot;My Father's House&quot; on her 1986 album [[Thirteen]] and the song &quot;Mansion on the Hill&quot; on the live album ''[[At the Ryman.]]''

[[Hank Williams III]] and covered the song &quot;[[Atlantic City (song)|Atlantic City]]&quot; on his 2002 album &quot;[[Lovesick Broke &amp; Driftin']].&quot;

[[Jamie T]] also covered the song &quot;[[Atlantic City (song)|Atlantic City]]&quot; as a b-side on his Emily's Heart EP and he regards &quot;Nebraska&quot; as one his favourite albums ever.&quot;

[[Automatic 7]] covered &quot;[[Atlantic City (song)|Atlantic City]]&quot; on its third album ''[[At Funeral speed]]''.

[[The Band]] covered &quot;[[Atlantic City (song)|Atlantic City]]&quot; on its 1993 album ''[[Jericho (album)|Jericho]]''.

&quot;[[Atlantic City (song)|Atlantic City]]&quot; was covered by The Hold Steady.

Cash also contributed to a widely-praised tribute album, ''[[Badlands - A Tribute to Bruce Springsteen's Nebraska]]'', which was released on the [[Sub Pop]] label in 2000 and produced by Jim Sampas. It featured covers of the Nebraska songs recorded in the stripped-down spirit of the original recordings by a wide-ranging group of artists including [[Hank Williams III]], [[Los Lobos]], [[Dar Williams]], [[Deana Carter]], [[Ani DiFranco]], [[Son Volt]], [[Ben Harper]], [[Aimee Mann]], and [[Michael Penn]].  Three additional tracks covered other Springsteen songs in the same vein: Johnny Cash's contribution was [[I'm On Fire]], a track from Springsteen's best-selling album ''[[Born In The USA]]''.

The Nebraska Project took place at Winter Garden/World Financial Center, New York City, on January 14, 2006, as the opening night concert of the 2006 [[New York Guitar Festival]] (www.newyorkguitarfestival.org). This live celebration and re-creation of the seminal album, produced by Festival creator and artistic director [[David Spelman]] and co-produced by A.J. Benson, and hosted by WFUV DJ John Platt, presented a diverse line-up of artists who covered the songs in album sequence. Line-up was as follows: &quot;Nebraska&quot;: Michelle Shocked / &quot;Atlantic City&quot;: Jesse Harris / &quot;Mansion on the Hill&quot;: The National / &quot;Johnny 99&quot;: Chocolate Genius / &quot;Highway Patrolman&quot;: Martha Wainwright with Marc Ribot / &quot;State Trooper&quot;: Dan Zanes with Vernon Reid / &quot;Used Cars&quot;: Laura Cantrell / &quot;Open All Night&quot;: Otis Taylor / &quot;My Father's House&quot;: Mark Eitzel / &quot;Reason to Believe&quot;: Kevin Kinney with Lenny Kaye / Encore (comprising all artists, plus special guest Bruce Springsteen): Oklahoma Hills / Plus instrumental interludes by Gary Lucas, Harry Manx, Marc Ribot, Kerryn Tolhurst &amp; David Spelman.

[[Kelly Clarkson]] compared her effort to move away from mainstream to edgier and more personal music on her third studio album ''[[My December]]'' to Springsteen's ''Nebraska''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20038840_20038841_20038857_4,00.html | work=Entertainment Weekly | title=Kelly in Control – Music – EW.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The song &quot;State Trooper&quot; was covered by The Veils, in the &quot;Like a Version&quot; segment of the Australian radio show Triple J. 

The Minneapolis band [[Boiled in Lead]] covered also &quot;State Trooper&quot; on its 1994 ''Antler Dance'' album.

Alt-country singer  [[Steve Earle]] covered &quot;State Trooper&quot; on his Live album in 1996 (in addition to including a live recording of it on the 2002 reissue of his debut album ''[[Guitar Town]]'', and also included a live version of &quot;Nebraska&quot; as the B-side of the &quot;Copperhead Road&quot; single sent to radio stations.  

Canadian band [[Cowboy Junkies]] covered the song &quot;State Trooper&quot; in its first album ''[[Whites Off Earth Now!!]]'' (1986). They also included an a cappella cover of &quot;My Father's House&quot; in their ''[[Rarities, B Sides and Slow, Sad Waltzes]]'' album (1999).

[[Chris Cornell]] regularly includes a cover of State Trooper in his setlist, which involves looping the main guitar riff towards the end of the song and performing a solo over the top of the riff.

[[The Cash Brothers]] included a song called &quot;Nebraska&quot;, inspired from the album, in their first album ''[[Raceway (album)|Raceway]]'' (1999). The song was included in a 2005 tribute album by [[Uncut (magazine)|Uncut]] magazine, ''Thunder Road - Songs inspired by The Boss''.

The short stories in ''[[Deliver Me From Nowhere]]'', a book by [[Tennessee Jones]] published in 2005, were inspired by the themes of ''Nebraska.''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.softskull.com/detailedbook.php?isbn=1-932360-59-X {{dead link|date=October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alternate Master (1st CD Master)===
The first CD release of the album in [[Japan]] used a different master tape than the one used on the LP or U.S. and European CD releases. The tape speed appears to be slightly faster than the original master tape, leading to shorter track lengths. &quot;My Father's House&quot; feature an additional 28 seconds of synthesizer not included in other versions of the album. This version of CD, which was released twice in Japan, is now unavailable except on the collector's market.

[[Image:PugneysCountryPark.jpg|thumb|350px|right|A view of the main lake at Pugneys Country Park from Sandal Castle.]]
'''Pugneys Country Park''' is a {{Convert|250|acre|km2|sing=on}} park located on the [[A636 road|A636]] between [[Wakefield]], [[West Yorkshire]], [[England]] and Junction 39 of the [[M1 motorway]].

The area was developed from a former [[opencast mine]] and a sand and gravel [[quarry]] and was opened to the public in 1985. It is overlooked by [[Sandal Castle]].

The park comprises two lakes, the larger of which is dedicated to non-powered [[watersports]] and the smaller lake is designated as a nature reserve. 

A 7.25&quot; gauge miniature railway, running round part of the larger lake, operates on weekends and bank holidays, and cafeteria facilities are available.

The nature reserve is home to a large flock of non-breeding [[swan]]s, with up to 100 in residence at any time. 

The lakes serve as a [[flood defence]] by providing an overflow from the [[River Calder, West Yorkshire|River Calder]].

'''Maaran''' (or ''Maaraar'', ''Maran'') is the name given to the temple musicians of [[Travancore]], [[Kingdom of Cochin|Cochin]] and [[Malabar District|Malabar]] in the state of [[Kerala]], India whose primary duty was to provide the traditional temple ''[[Sopanam]]'' music. Their position in the caste system varies from place to place in Kerala. In Travancore, although they were [[Ambalavasi]] they had status intermediate between [[Itasseri Nair]] subcaste and Chempukotti Nair (Intermediate between Nair proper and Nair Inferior). In Malabar they enjoyed relatively superior status.

==Origin and occupation==
Below is an excerpt from the Madras Census Report of 1901 which reports the Maarans as:

{{quote|Temple servants and drummers in Malabar. Like many of the Malabar castes they must have come from the East Coast ([[Tamil Nadu]]) as their name frequently appears in the [[Tanjore]] inscriptions of 1013 AD. They followed, then, the same occupation as that by which they live today and appear to have held a tolerably high social position. In parts of North Malabar they are known as ''Ochhans'' instead of ''Marar'' while in Travancore kingdom ''[[Panicker]]'' and ''[[Kurup]]'' are their titles.}}

Edgar Thurston in his &quot;Castes and Tribes of Southern India&quot; states their traditional origin and occupation as follows: Before the days of [[Sankaracharya]] their sole occupation was beating the drums in Brahminical Temples. When Sankaracharya was refused assistance in the cremation of his mother by the [[Namboodiri]] Brahmins, he is believed to have sought in despair the help of one of these temple servants with whose aid the corpse was divided into eight parts and deposited in the pit. For undertaking this duty which the Namboodiris repudiated from a sense of offended religious feeling, the particular Maran was thrown out of his caste by the general community and a compromise had to be effected by the sage with the rest of the caste who returned in a body on the day of purification along with the excommunicated man and helped Sankaracharya to close his mother's death ceremonies. In recognition of this timely help Sankaracharya is said to have declared the Maran to be an indispensable functionary at the death ceremonies of Namboodiris and Ambalavasis.

[[Image:Shadkala Govinda Marar.jpg|right|thumb|Portrait of [[Shadkala Govinda Marar]] by [[Raja Ravi Varma]]]]



The traditional occupations of the Maarans was sounding or playing the ''panchavadya'' or five musical instruments in temples known as the &quot;''Sankhu'' (Conch), ''Timila'', ''Chenda'', ''Kaimani'' and ''Maddalam''&quot;. The ''Asu'' and ''Pani'' are sounded by the highest dignitaries known as ''Asupani'' Maarans. The beating of the ''Pani'' is the accompaniment of expiatory offerings to the ''[[Matrikas|Saptamata]]'' or Seven Mothers of [[Hindu]] religious writings namely ''Brahmi'', ''Maheshwari'', ''Kaumari'', ''Vaishnavi'', ''Varahi'', ''[[Sachi|Indrani]]'' and ''[[Chamunda]]''. There are certain well established rules regarding the hymns to be recited and the music to be played. So religiously have these rules to be followed that during the ''Utsavabali'' that the priest who makes the offering, the [[Variar]] who carries the sacred lamp and the Maaran, all have to fast and dress themselves in the orthodox Brahminical fashion, with the ''Uttariya'' or upper garment tied around their torso like the Sacred thread.

The higher classes of Maarans (Asupani Maarans) claim six privileges ''Pani'' or ''Pano'', ''Koni'', ''Thirumuttom'', ''Nadumuttam'', ''Velichor'' and ''Poochor''. ''Pani'' is the right to play the ''Asu'' and ''Pani''. ''Koni'' literally means a ladder and refers to the stretcher made of bamboo and ''kusa'' grass or straw on which corpses of high caste Hindus are laid. ''Thirumuttom'' is the right to sweep the inner courtyard of Temples, a privilege otherwise reserved for the Ambalavasi castes. ''Nadumuttam'' is the right of erecting a small pandal or booth like in the courtyard of a Namboodiri house where oblations are offered to the departed spirit on the tenth day since death. ''Velichor'' is the right to retain remains of the sacrificial rice offered to the manes and ''Poochor'' the right to retain a part of the offering of flowers and food made to the deity. 

The higher classes of Maarans in Malabar consider themselves superior to other Maarars owing to ritual purity and abstinence from flesh and liquor and also their aloofness from the lower classes who assist at funeral ceremonies and function as priests for the Nairs. During Jati Nirnayam they were classed inferior to Nair proper (the three proper Nair castes: Illakkar, Swaroopakkar &amp; Kiryathil) and hence sometimes considered the lower ranking section of Ambalavasis. These families were known in Malabar as ''Marars'' whereas in Travancore they continued to be included among the other ''Maarans''.&lt;ref&gt;Travancore State Manual, V Nagam Aiya&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=July 2012}}

Though playing the music in temples is their main vocation, they are indispensable in Namboodiri, Kshatriya and Ambalavasi funeral ceremonies and almost all ceremonies of the Nairs such as ''Kettu Kalyanam''. Some practised sorcery and witchcraft and were also priests in temples dedicated to [[Bhadrakali]]. They assisted the Namboodiris and [[Raja]]hs during the ''Chowalam'' or tonsure ceremony.

==Subdivisions==
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2012}}
In Malabar, [[Kingdom of Cochin|Cochin]] and North Travancore, up to [[Alapuzha]], the Maarans are divided broadly into two groups, the ''Marars'', also known as ''Asupanis'', and the remaining ''Maarans''. The Marars are those higher classes of Maarans who distanced themselves from any other services, such as serving as funeral priests etc., but temple service and hence secured a higher status, among the Ambalavasis, with the honorific title of ''Marar''. From Alapuzha southwards, there exists no such division and even the ''Asupanis'' were included among the remaining Maarans of Central and Southern Travancore.

The Maarans here are divided into several groups on various bases. Sometimes they are classed on the basis of the castes whose various rites and rituals they perform such as ''Illathu Maarans'' for those who were priests of the Illathu Nairs. Likewise they may be classed as per locality also. For instance ''Tekkumkur Maarans'' and ''Vadakumkur Maarans''. On the basis of occupation the highest were the ''Asupani Maarans'' followed by subcastes known as ''Seethikans'', ''Mangala Maarans'' etc. However the real social divisions of the Travancore Maarans are only four and they are:

*'''Orunul Maarans''': This was a comparatively small class of Maarans. What is unique about these Maarans is that whoever does the ''Thali [[Kettu Kalyanam]]'' or ritual marriage ceremony of four days and ties the ''Thali'' alone is the husband of their females. But in Kerala the husband who tied the ''thali'' was only the ritual husband and actual marriage or [[Sambandham]] was carried out later with another man of the same or superior caste. The Orunul Maaran females may have Sambandham or consort either with the ''Thali'' tier alias the ritual husband or else only with a Namboodiri and no other Maaran may be accepted for Sambandham. Thurston states thus about the Orunul Maarans:{{quote|The word 'Orunul' means one string and signifies the absence of widow marriage...It is a section of Marans whose widows donot remarry...they look upon themselves as higher than the Irunuls, basing their superiority in the custom obtaining among them of marrying only once in their lifetime...However in the event of that calamity (a childless widow), marrying a [[Brahmin]] or one of distinctly higher caste is tolerated...}}

*'''Irunul Maarans''': Unlike Orunul Maarans, it is not mandatory for the Irunul Maarans that their women have [[Sambandham]] either with their ''Thali'' husband or else a Brahmin. They may consort through Sambandham any Maaran of the same caste and not necessarily the ''Thali'' tier. Widow marriage is permitted for the Irunul Maarans.

*'''Chepat and Kulangi Maarans''': These were initially local varieties from Chepat and Kulangi and later became independent sub-castes of the Maarans. Ranking at the same level are two other Maaran subcastes  known as ''Asthikurichi'' and ''Pulikkal'' Maarans. While the former assisted Brahmins at funeral ceremonies the latter were required to purify the Nairs after pollution. These Maarans also assisted the Brahmins and [[Kshatriya]]s in the ''Chowlam'' ceremony. They are also known as ''Seethikans'' derived from ''Chaitika'' meaning one concerned with the funeral pyre.

*'''Muttal Maarans''': They are those Maarans considered lowest in the scale and found only in Kalkulam Taluk, now in Tamil Nadu. Traditionally they are supposed to have been an inferior class of people who were elevated in that district to a significantly superior position, rendered necessary by a temple exigency. The very term 'Muttal' means substitute or emergency employee.

==Manners and customs==
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2012}}
The customs and ceremonies of the Maarans are the same as the Nairs excepting for the ''Annaprasana'' ceremony of first food giving when the Maaran child partakes consecrated food of the temple unlike the Nair child whose ceremony is performed at home. Maarans could be purified from death pollution by the Namboodiris while they themselves were purificatory priests of the Nairs. Technically all Maarans are expected to be abstainers from meat but barring the ''Asupani'' class (''Marars'' and ''Asupani Maarans'') and those in the service of temples and Brahmins, this rule was not uniformly practised.

==Status==
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2012}} 
The status of the Maaran community varies from place to place in Kerala. Eventually they were broadly divided into two classes namely the ''Marars'' of Malabar and the ''Maarans'' of Travancore. The Marars correspond to the Asupani Maarans and were considered higher in status owing to their aloofness from the other Maaran subcastes as also from performing any other services, but those within the temple, whereas the Maarans of Travancore were considered lower in status. Thurston mentions how higher classes of Maarans would be polluted by eating the food of a Nair belonging to lower subcastes. All the same, a Nair belonging to higher subcaste would also lose his caste status by eating the food of a Maaran.

&quot;'''Three minute men'''&quot; were patrons of a quasi-legal prostitution industry north of Hotel Street near [[Honolulu Harbor]] from December 1941 to September 1944 (World War II).  After martial law was declared in [[Honolulu]], local police corruption and regulations were superseded, and a price of three dollars was set by military authorities.  To satisfy an immense demand, men were kept in a &quot;bullpen&quot; of three or more rooms, permitting men to dress and undress in assembly-line fashion, while each received only three minutes of personal attention.  The practice may have been initiated by [[Jean O'Hara]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rhr.dukejournals.org/cgi/reprint/1992/52/54.pdf|title=Hotel Street:Prostitution and the Politics of War|author=Beth Bailey and David Farber|year=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Video documentary ''Sex in World War II:The Pacific Front'', airing on [[History (U.S. TV channel)|The History Channel]] in the United States&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Four Women of Egypt''''' (original French title '''''Quatre femmes d'Égypte''''') is a 1997 Canadian-Egyptian [[documentary film]] by Tahani Rached. The film revolves around four female friends from Egypt with opposing religious, social, and political views in modern-day Egypt.  The film was highly acclaimed and won several awards in documentary film festivals.&lt;ref name='nbfc'&gt;{{cite web |url=http://onf-nfb.gc.ca/eng/collection/film/?id=33476 |title=Film Collection - National Film Board of Canada - Four Women of Egypt |author= |date=3 August 2010|work=National Film Board of Canada |publisher= |accessdate=6 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cast==
'''[[Wedad Mitry]]''' has been a lifelong journalist. A student activist, she was the only woman elected to the Student Union at Cairo University in 1951. That same year she joined the Women's Popular Resistance Committee (founded by the feminist [[Saiza Nabarawi]]).&lt;ref name='aljadeed'&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aljadid.com/content/speaking-straight-four-women-egypt |title=Speaking Straight: Four Women of Egypt |author=Margot Badran |year=1998|work=A review and Record of Arab Culture and Art|publisher=Al Jadeed |accessdate=6 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

'''[[Safinaz Kazem]]''', a journalist, theater critic and writer, is the author of many books. In the 1960s she was a graduate student in the United States-in Kansas, Chicago, and New York. She is the ex-wife of the Egyptian poet [[Ahmed Fouad Negm]] and the mother of the political activist and writer [[Nawara Negm]].&lt;ref name='aljadeed'/&gt;

'''[[Shahenda Maklad]]''' was active in student and nationalist movements, running as a candidate in parliamentary campaigns. She continues her tireless fight for peasants' rights and other populist causes. Her husband, [[Hussein Salah]] was politically assassinated on 30 April 1966 in the town of [[Kamshish]].&lt;ref name='aljadeed'/&gt;
 
'''[[Amina Rachid]]''' is a committed leftist, was born into the old upper class, the granddaughter of [[Ismail Sidki]] (a former prime minister). She completed her studies in Paris where she was active in the Arab Student Association in France and worked for several years at the [[French National Centre for Scientific Research]]. Her political commitment brought her back to Egypt where she teaches French literature at Cairo University.&lt;ref name='aljadeed'/&gt;

==Plot==
The film opens with four middle aged women walking on a bridge at the barrages south of Cairo, Egypt. The four women speak throughout the film about Egypt, its politics, culture, and Islam, the most popular religion in the country. They connect the politics and ideologies of past and present with their own experience. The four women are friends and were born under the colonial occupation of Egypt. They share their memories that span five decades throughout the film. The four women were political prisoners under the regime of [[Anwar Sadat]].&lt;ref name=Cole&gt;{{cite news|last=Cole|first=Susan G.|authorlink=Susan G.

It was the first spaceflight to send animals into orbit and return them safely back to Earth. Launched on August 19, 1960 it paved the way for the first human orbital flight, [[Vostok 1]], which was launched less than eight months later.

Korabl-Sputnik 2 was the second attempt to launch a Vostok capsule with dogs on board as the first try on July 28 had been unsuccessful after the Blok G strap-on suffered a fire and breakdown in one of the combustion chambers, followed by its breaking off of the booster 19 seconds after launch. The launch vehicle then disintegrated, the rest of the strap-ons separating and flying in random directions with the Blok I core stage continuing on its trajectory until Range Safety issued the destruct command at T+28 seconds.{{cn|date=February 2013}} The Vostok descent module was blasted free of the exploding booster, but the dogs were killed upon impact with the ground. It was believed that the combustion chamber disintegration was due to longitudinal vibrations. This created a considerable uproar as this problem (which had plagued earlier 8K72 launches) had supposedly been corrected.{{cn|date=February 2013}}

The launch of Korabl-Sputnik 2 occurred on 19 August 1960, using a [[Vostok-L]] [[carrier rocket]]. Official sources reported the launch time to have been 08:44:06 UTC, however Sergei Voevodin gave it as 08:38:24.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} A radio station in [[Bonn]], [[West Germany]], was among the first to pick up signals from the spacecraft, which were confirmed on the third orbit by a [[Sweden|Swedish]] radio station.

The spacecraft carried two dogs, [[Belka and Strelka]], 40 [[mice]], two [[rats]] and a variety of [[plants]], as well as a television camera which took images of the dogs. The spacecraft returned to Earth at 06:00:00 UTC on 20 August, the day after its launch, although telemetry revealed that one dog had suffered seizures during the fourth orbit. Thus, it was decided to limit the first manned flight to three orbits. All of the animals were recovered safely, and a year later Strelka had a litter of puppies, one of which was sent to First Lady [[Jacqueline Kennedy]] as a goodwill present from the Soviet Union. President Kennedy's advisers initially opposed taking the dog for fear that the Soviets might have planted microphones in its body to listen in on national defense meetings.

'''Mexicans in Omaha''' are people living in [[Omaha, Nebraska]], [[United States]] who have citizenship or [[ancestry|ancestral]] connections to the country [[Mexico]]. They have contributed to the economic, social and cultural well-being of Omaha for more than a century. Mexicans, or [[Latino]] people identified incorrectly as being from Mexico, have been accounted for in the [[history of Omaha]], [[Nebraska]] since 1900. The entire Latino population of Omaha increased ninety percent between 1990 and 1997.&lt;ref&gt;Lopez, David A. (2000). [http://www.jsri.msu.edu/RandS/research/cb/cb12.html &quot;Latinos in Omaha: An Examination of Socioeconomic Measures for Latinos in South Omaha.&quot;] ''Statistical Brief No. 12''. The Julian Samora Research Institute at Michigan State University.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mexican-Americans in Omaha have been extensively studied since at least the late 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;T. Earl Sullenger, (1929) &quot;The Mexican Population of Omaha,&quot; ''Journal of Applied Sociology, VIII.'' May–June. p. 289.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998 a Mexican immigrant family in Omaha was featured in a ''[[Washington Post]]'' article. The article noted reluctance by some immigrants to assimilate, in terms of their thinking they had to give up their language or culture. Studies since then have noted that Latino children, like many immigrant children, have adapted more readily to the United States, but also like many immigrant groups, are proud to maintain traditions.

==History==
The presence of Mexicans in Omaha was documented to the [[History of Omaha|beginning of the city]] in 1854, and the first permanent residents arrived with the railroads in 1860.&lt;ref&gt;Arbelaez, Maria S. (2000) [http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICDocs/data/ericdocs2sql/content_storage_01/0000019b/80/17/1c/82.pdf &quot;Good Friday in Omaha, Nebraska: A Mexican Celebration,&quot;] In ''National Association of African American Studies &amp; National Association of Hispanic and Latino Studies 2000 Literature Monograph Series.''

1900 was the beginning of the first large wave of Mexicans immigrating to the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;McWilliams, C. and Meier, M.(1990) ''North from Mexico: The Spanish-Speaking People of the United States.'' . New York: Praeger.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[University of Nebraska at Omaha]], around 1900, five Mexican-born residents lived in Omaha, and by 1910 there were twenty-nine.

===Communities===
In the early decades of the 1900s, Mexican families established themselves in ''[[Colonia (United States)|colonia]]s''&lt;ref&gt;Valdés, D.N. (2000) ''Barrios Nortenos: St. Paul and Midwestern Mexican Communities in the Twentieth Century.'' University of Texas Press. p 33.&lt;/ref&gt; next to the [[Chicago, Burlington, and Quincy Railroad]] depot south of [[Little Italy (Omaha, Nebraska)|Little Italy]] and [[Little Bohemia (Omaha, Nebraska)|Little Bohemia]]. The depot was called [[Gibson Station]], and was located at South First and Hascal Streets near the [[Missouri River]].&lt;ref&gt;T. Earl Sullenger, (1929) &quot;The Mexican Population of Omaha,&quot; ''Journal of Applied Sociology, VIII.'' May–June. p. 291.&lt;/ref&gt; Near South 72nd and Q Streets there was another ''[[barrio]]'' where Mexican families lived in [[railroad car]]s next to the Union Pacific-Santa Fe station. More Mexican families lived among Italian, Polish, Hungarian, and Czech immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;T. Earl Sullenger, (1929) &quot;The Mexican Population of Omaha,&quot; ''Journal of Applied Sociology, VIII.'' May–June. p. 287.&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the community is said to have lived in the [[Brown Park]] neighborhood, as well.&lt;ref&gt;Thiele, S., Jordan, T.E., Lopez, D.A., et al. (2001) ''The Latino Experience in Omaha.'' E. Mellen Press. p 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other Mexican communities were near the [[Burlington Train Station]] around South Sixth Street; in [[Omaha, Nebraska|Carville]], near [[Gibson Guitar Corporation|Gibson]] in South Omaha along the [[Missouri River]], &quot;where most lived in railroad cars on Burlington Railroad property&quot;, and along Spring Street. J.B. Hernández, a railroad worker, was the acknowledged leader of Carville. His family was viewed as the &quot;aristocrats of Carville&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Valdés, D.N. (2000) ''Barrios Nortenos: St. Paul and Midwestern Mexican Communities in the Twentieth Century.'' University of Texas Press. p 78.&lt;/ref&gt;

There was also a large community east of the Missouri River in [[Council Bluffs]]. The largest concentration of Mexicans and Mexican Americans in Omaha lived near the [[packing house]]s and [[Union Stockyards (Omaha)|Union Stockyards]] of South Omaha.&lt;ref&gt;Valdés, D.N. (2000) ''Barrios Nortenos: St. Paul and Midwestern Mexican Communities in the Twentieth Century.'' University of Texas Press. p 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

Today the majority of Mexicans and Mexican-Americans live in South Omaha, also called South O. A strong Mexican-American presence thrives there, with numerous public murals and exhibitions of [[Mexican culture]] throughout the community. Along with a variety of businesses, churches and community organizations, the area features [[El Museo Latino]]. It hosts four visits per year of the Mobile Mexican Consultant of Denver.&lt;ref&gt;Arbelaez, Maria S.

===Workforce===
According to one study about the period 1900–1930, &quot;Early censuses report few Mexicans, and existing statistics are ambiguous. Mostly, Mexicans were accounted as 'floaters,' shifting jobs between meat packing plants, section hands on the railroads, and agricultural laborers...&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Arbelaez, M.

P 163.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Nebraska State Historical Society]], there are a few remaining Mexican elders who came to Omaha through [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]] as railroad workers for the [[Union Pacific]] and the [[BNSF Railway]].

===Crime===
In the 1930s [[Crime in Omaha|crime among Mexican Americans]] ranked &quot;higher than any other immigrant class born in the city.&quot; Researchers attributed this to poverty, language barriers, police politics and the lack of political representation.&lt;ref&gt;Valdés, D.N. (2000) ''Barrios Nortenos: St. Paul and Midwestern Mexican Communities in the Twentieth Century.'' University of Texas Press. p 59.&lt;/ref&gt; Mexican Americans in Omaha were also the target of [[Racial tension in Omaha, Nebraska|racial tension]], with one period report finding, &quot;at social gatherings of the schools and churches, Mexican children were spat upon and called &quot;[[Greaser (derogatory)|greaser]]s&quot; by other children.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Valdés, D.N.

==Present==
===Population===
In the early 1970s a population survey conducted by the Lutheran Ministries of Omaha estimated that there were 6,490 Latinos in Omaha, with two-thirds of the population coming from Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;Arbelaez, M. (2006) ''[http://www.unomaha.edu/ollas/pdf/Religion%20Report.pdf Religion and Community: Mexican Americans in South Omaha (1900–1980).]'' OLLAS Special Report No. 4. Omaha, NE: Office of Latino/Latin American Studies at the University of Nebraska at Omaha.&lt;/ref&gt; A 1978 study found that Mexican Americans in Omaha felt particular satisfaction with their lifestyle and the services that they received from the U.S. government. The same study found [[civic engagement]] high among the population. While study participants felt like they generally were not welcomed throughout their community, they were accepted.&lt;ref&gt;Comer, J.C. (1978) &quot;'Street-Level' Bureaucracy and Political Support: Some Findings on Mexican Americans,&quot; ''Urban Affairs Review, 14''(2). pp 207–227.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nebraska's Latino population nearly doubled from 1990 to 2005, largely due to increases in towns with meatpacking operations located within a two hundred mile radius of Omaha. While most of that population is Mexican, the numbers are not available.&lt;ref&gt;Bacon, D. (2005) [http://tapdev.browsermedia.com/cs/articles?article=and_the_winner_is_ &quot;And the Winner Is...

According to the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Omaha]], 74 percent of Mexicans and their American-born children in Omaha are Catholic. The streets of South Omaha, particularly the [[South Omaha Main Street Historic District]], are packed with religious celebrations throughout the year, including the Festival of the [[Virgin of Guadalupe]], the [[Day of the Dead]] and many other holidays in the Catholic religious calendar.&lt;ref&gt;Arbelaez, M.
