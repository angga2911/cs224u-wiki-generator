'''''Agave eggersiana''''' is an [[endangered species]] of spiky [[plant]] which grows in the [[Virgin Islands]], in dry, exposed areas. ''Agave eggersiana'' is a perennial herb known only from the island of St. Croix of the U.S. Virgin Islands (USFWS 1998a). It is known from a small number of wild and cultivated plants (USFWS 1998a). It is being cultivated at the St. George Village Botanical Garden in St. Croix U.S.V.I.(USFWS 1998a) and at Fairchild Botanical Garden in south Florida.

This species can grow up to seven meters in height and has large, yellow tubular flowers that produce flattened black seeds (USFWS 1998a). A small number of plants remain on private land and are threatened by tourist development (USFWS 1998b). The greatest threat is habitat destruction brought on by residential development on private land. Other threats include feral pigs and goats on National Park Service land (USFWS 1998b). Research needs include distribution and abundance, general biology and ecology (USFWS 1998a). The U.S. Fish and Wildlife requests that any interested parties (concerned government agencies, the scientific community and/or industry) submit data or suggestions concerning this species (USFWS 1998b).

'''Honfleur''' is a [[municipality (Quebec)|municipality]] of approximately 750 people in the [[Bellechasse Regional County Municipality]] in the [[Chaudière-Appalaches]] region of [[Quebec]]. The [[Boyer River (Quebec)|Boyer River]] takes its source in the municipality.

==History==
Founded in 1904, the municipality of Honfleur is similar to Honfleur, city in [[Calvados]], Normandie, where many sailors came from during the 16th and 17th century to North America. The name comes from the archbishop of [[Quebec]], cardinal [[Louis-Nazaire Bégin]], (1840-1925) whose ancestor came from Saint-Léonard-de-Honfleur, archdiocise of Lisieux, also situated in Calvados. During this period, the civil parish was erected. The territory was part of the seigneurie Taschereau, once named seigneurie Joliette, where municipalities such as Saint-Anselme, Saint-Gervais, Saint-Lazare and Sainte-Claire were located.

Ottawa's '''Vanier''' neighbourhood is a former municipality that ceased to exist in 2001 by becoming part of the city of [[Ottawa]], [[Ontario]]. It no longer has a majority francophone population. In fact, in 2012 its francophone population has shrunk to less than 40% from 63% in the early 1980s. The Vanier neighbourhood is located in the east of Ottawa across the [[Rideau River]] from the neighbourhoods of Lowertown and [[Sandy Hill, Ottawa|Sandy Hill]], and just south of [[Rockcliffe Park]], [[New Edinburgh (Ottawa)|New Edinburgh]], [[Lindenlea]], and [[Manor Park (Ottawa)|Manor Park]] . To the east of Vanier are the suburbs of [[Gloucester, Ontario|Gloucester]]. Vanier has a relatively small area with a high population density.  Montreal Road is the main thoroughfare of the community. 

In 1908, the communities of '''Janeville''', '''Clarkstown''' and '''Clandeboye''' were joined to form the village of '''Eastview'''. In 1913, '''Eastview''' was incorporated as a town. Originally it was a popular destination for [[civil servant]]s who wished to live at a distance from downtown. It later saw a large influx of [[French Canadian]]s and became the main francophone area in the capital. 

During the Depression, Eastview held the attention of the entire nation, as it became a public forum for national debates on birth control during [[The Eastview Birth Control Trial]], which lasted from 1936 to 1937. Significant controversy erupted when [[Dorothea Palmer]] was believed to have been distributing birth control information to the poorer, predominantly Catholic neighbourhoods. Later, in 1963 it became a city, and in 1969 was renamed after the recently-deceased [[Governor General of Canada]], [[Georges Vanier]].

Vanier has undergone significant changes since 2007, where it was an area associated with crime and prostitution.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ottawacitizen.com/life/Taking+back+Vanier/5211875/story.html&lt;/ref&gt;  Starting with an area closer to the Rideau River, it is increasingly considered a target for [[gentrification]]{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}.  It is one of the last relatively inexpensive Ottawa neighbourhoods with a desirable location next to downtown.

Vanier offers a wide choice of retail shops, strip malls, eateries, bars, etc.  Both subsidized and self-financed housing is available here, with several existing and proposed upscale condominiums and infill developments. The population on the western edge of Vanier closer to the [[Rideau River]], esp. the Kingsview Park neighbourhood, is among the more affluent.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}

Like nearby Lowertown, Ottawa's Vanier neighbourhood is home to a number of French-speaking immigrants from Africa and elsewhere. It is also the site of an urban [[maple syrup]] Maple Sugar Festival (Festival des Sucres) held in spring, and home to an outdoor Catholic shrine, the Grotte de Lourdes.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}

In 2006, the Museoparc Vanier Museopark opened to public.  This new local and community museum is part of the Ottawa Museum Network among 10 others.  Located in Parc Richelieu, it is a heritage site designated in 1997 by the City of Vanier and protected under the Ontario Heritage Act.  As part of the designation document, the {{convert|17.5|acre|km2}} domain include the Maple Forest (Sugar Bush), the Vanier branch of the Ottawa Public Library, statue of Notre-Dame-d'Afrique, and the two remaining pilars of the original gate at the entrance of the park.  

Vanier is part of the federal [[Electoral district (Canada)|riding]] of [[Ottawa—Vanier]], and the [[Ottawa—Vanier (provincial electoral district)|Ottawa—Vanier provincial riding]]. It is traditionally one of the staunchly [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]] ridings in Canada, having voted for the party consistently since the riding's creation. Federally, it is represented by [[Mauril Belanger]], and provincially by [[Madeleine Meilleur]].

According to the [[Canada 2001 Census]]:
*Population: 17,632
*% Change (1996-2001): 2.2
*Dwellings: 9,114
*Area (km².): 2.93

'''''Pulveroboletus''''' is a [[genus]] of fungi in the [[Boletaceae]] family. The genus has a [[cosmopolitan distribution]] and contains 25 species.&lt;ref name=Kirk2008/&gt;

==Taxonomy==
The genus was first described by American mycologist [[William Alphonso Murrill]] in 1909. He defined species in the genus as having a cap and stem &quot;clothed with a conspicuous sulphur-yellow, powdery tomentum, which may be the remains of a universal veil: context white, fleshy; tubes adnate, yellowish, covered with a large veil: spores oblong-ellipsoid, ochraceous-brown: stipe solid, annulate, not reticulate.&quot; Murrill set ''Pulveroboletus ravenelii'' as the [[type species]]''.&lt;ref name=Murrill1909/&gt;

'''Rigobert Bonne''' (1727–1795) was one of the most important [[cartographer]]s of the late 18th century. 

In 1773 Bonne succeeded Jacques Nicolas Bellin as Royal Cartographer to France in the office of the Hydrographer at the Depôt de la Marine. Working in his official capacity, Bonne compiled some of the most detailed and accurate maps of the period. Bonne’s work represents an important step in the evolution of the cartographic ideology away from the decorative work of the 17th and early 18th century towards a more detail oriented and practical aesthetic. With regard to the rendering of terrain Bonne maps bear many stylistic similarities to those of his predecessor, Bellin. However, Bonne maps generally abandon such common 18th century decorative features such as hand coloring, elaborate decorative [[cartouche]]s, and [[compass rose]]s. 

While mostly focusing on coastal regions, the work of Bonne is highly regarded for its detail, historical importance, and overall aesthetic appeal.

'''Barnwell''' is a village in [[southern Alberta]], [[Canada]]. It is located {{convert|10|km|mi|abbr=on}} west of [[Taber, Alberta (town)|Taber]] and {{convert|43|km|mi|abbr=on}} east of [[Lethbridge]] along the [[Crowsnest Highway]], in the [[Taber, Alberta (municipal district)|Municipal District of Taber]].

== History ==
In the late 19th century, a [[boxcar]] was located on a [[rail siding]] in what is now Barnwell. It was used as a telegraph office for local settlers and the railroad, and the area was named Woodpecker. In 1908, the area was renamed Bountiful to correspond to the local school district. A short while later, it was renamed to Barnwell because another community already had the name of Bountiful. The name Barnwell came from William Barnwell, a longtime employee of the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

Many of the early settlers of the area were coal miners employed in mines nearby at the former community of Coal City. The mines closed in 1920, and miners left for the [[Crowsnest Pass, Alberta|Crowsnest Pass]] and [[Drumheller, Alberta|Drumheller]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

== Demographics ==
In the [[Canada 2011 Census|2011 Census]], the Village of Barnwell had a population of 771 living in 213 of its 217 total dwellings, a 24.8% change from its 2006 adjusted population of 618.

==Plot==
The plot involves [[Hemingford, Nebraska]], a town near Gatlin (the original film's setting).  The people of Hemingford decide to adopt the surviving sadistic, savages of  children in Gatlin, intending to help the children start new lives.  Unfortunately for the well-meaning locals, the children go out to the cornfield where one of the corn cult members, Micah, has been possessed by a demon sent by He Who Walks Behind The Rows, the demonic entity the cult worships. 

Caught in the middle are reporter John Garret and his son Danny, who have a troubled relationship.  John is in town working on a story about the children.  He runs into two of his former coworkers, Bobby and Mac, who are leaving town and are soon killed by He Who Walks Behind The Rows.  John begins a relationship with bed and breakfast owner Angela.  Danny spends most of his time with a local, orphan girl, Lacey.

Micah and the other children murder a local woman, Ruby Burke by dropping her house on her.  Then they kill another member of the town by using a type of voodoo doll causing him to bleed to death.  John begins to ask the town doctor questions about what is going on, but the doctor acts suspiciously and asks John to leave.  The doctor is later stabbed to death by the children.  Micah and the children then kill Mrs. Burke's sister, but it appears as if she was simply hit by a car.

John teams up with Frank Red Bear, a professor at a nearby University to try and figure out what is going on.  They discover that the residents of the town are planning to sell spoiled corn from the previous year's harvest along with the new crop.  The spoiled corn has a toxin growing on it which they believe is the source of the children's delusions.  The town Sheriff captures them, ties them up, and tries to kill them with a corn harvester, but they escape.  

The Sheriff and the rest of the town attend a meeting, but the children lock them inside and set the building on fire killing all of them.  The children kidnap Angela and Lacey and bring them out into the cornfield.  Danny agrees to join the children and Micah orders him to sacrifice Lacey.  Danny hesitates, then John and Frank arrive driving the harvester.  One of the children shoots Frank with an arrow and he is apparently killed.  Danny and John free Lacey and Angela and attempt to escape, but they are eventually captured.  Micah begins to harness the power of He Who Walks Behind The Rows.  Then, Frank, who is still alive, starts up the harvester before he finally dies. Micah's robe gets caught in it, and calls for Danny to help. Danny hesitates but doesn't leave. Then, Micah's face transforms into the demon that possessed him. The demon then leaves him, making Micah himself again. Danny runs in to help him but it was too late, Micah was pulled in by the harvester and was shredded to bits.  The rest of the children scatter, and Danny, Angela, Lacey, and John leave the clearing.

Later, John and Danny reconcile and then they, Lacey, and Angela burn Frank's body and give him a funeral before they all drive off together away from Nebraska.

==Production==
Film production began at the end of spring 1992, and shooting began in summer 1992 in [[Liberty, North Carolina]]. Most of the cast were locals, including the children. The scene involving an elderly woman flying through a store window after her wheelchair becomes controlled by Micah was filmed in downtown Ramseur, North Carolina. The scene where Micah and the children of the corn burn the town elders was filmed in a home at the corner of Asheboro St. and Luther Ave. in Liberty. The home was burned for the film and a vacant lot remains where the house once stood. The production crew used a local parsonage at the corner of Fayetteville and Raleigh Sts. in Liberty as its headquarters during shooting. [[Brian Yuzna]]'s son Xeno appears as one of the children of the corn.

In the DVD commentary, director David F. Price said during the shoot there was a local Christian group who held a few (low-key) protests during filming, and he received a dead rodent on his door step as a warning. As a result, the production constructed their own church for a few scenes in the film. Despite this, no actual incidents occurred. False, they used the Chatham Meeting house at the Snow Camp Outdoor Theatre.

Also in the DVD commentary, Price said the ending involving Red Bear painting a stone was added at the last minute. Originally, it involved John Garrett making a phone call to his tabloid at a phone booth by the side of the road near the cornfield, only to have it swallowed into the earth by He Who Walks Behind The Rows, killing him. This was scrapped due to budget constraints.

According to the original draft of the script, the film was going to be called &quot;Children of the Corn 2: Deadly Harvest&quot;.

==Release==

The film was originally only released on VHS in North America. In the UK, a PAL DVD was released but is time-compressed. On April 12th 2011, a Region 1 DVD was released by Echo Bridge Home Entertainment.

==Alternate Versions==
U.S. print - 94 minutes&lt;br&gt;
U.K. - Canada print - 89 minutes (Deleting a scene in which Micah becomes evil, which incorporates some CGI effects. This version also changes the opening credits music.)

'''Anomura''' (sometimes '''[[Anomala]]''') is a group of [[Decapoda|decapod]] [[crustacean]]s, including [[hermit crab]]s and others. Although the names of many anomurans includes the word ''crab'', all true [[crab]]s are in the sister group to the Anomura, the [[Crab|Brachyura]] (the two groups together form the [[clade]] [[Meiura]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gerhard Scholtz &amp; Stefan Richter |year=1995 |title=Phylogenetic systematics of the reptantian Decapoda (Crustacea, Malacostraca) |journal=[[Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society]] |volume=113 |issue=3 |pages=289–328 |url=http://arthroinfo.org/pdfs/826/826.pdf |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]] |doi=10.1111/j.1096-3642.1995.tb00936.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The name Anomura derives from an old classification in which [[Reptantia|reptant]] decapods were divided into Macrura (long-tailed), Brachyura (short-tailed) and Anomura (differently-tailed). The alternative name Anomala reflects the unusual variety of forms in this group; whereas all crabs share some obvious similarities, the various groups of anomurans are quite dissimilar.&lt;ref name=&quot;Poore&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Gary Poore |year=2004 |title=Marine Decapod Crustacea of Southern Australia: a Guide to Identification |publisher=[[CSIRO Publishing]] |isbn=978-0-643-09925-8 |chapter=Anomura – hermit crabs, porcelain crabs and squat lobsters |pages=215–287 |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=TptuZCY3OU0C&amp;pg=PA215}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The group has been moulded by several instances of [[carcinisation]] – the development of a crab-like body form.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ahyong&quot;&gt;{{cite book |editor=Joel W. Martin, Keith A. Crandall &amp; Darryl L. Felder |year=2009 |title=Decapod Crustacean Phylogenetics |volume=18 |series=Crustacean issues |publisher=[[CRC Press]] |isbn=978-1-4200-9258-5 |author=Shane T. Ahyong, Kareen E. Schnabel &amp; Elizabeth W. Maas |chapter=Anomuran phylogeny: new insights from molecular data |pages=399–414 |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Bxs6SgSW2kQC&amp;pg=PA399 |doi=10.1201/9781420092592-c20 |isbn=978-1-4200-9258-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the [[king crab]]s (Lithodidae), [[porcelain crab]]s (Porcellanidae) and [[hairy stone crab]] (Lomisidae) are all separate instances of carcinisation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ahyong&quot;/&gt;

As decapods (meaning ''ten-legged''), anomurans have ten [[pereiopod]]s, but the last pair of these is reduced in size, and often hidden inside the gill chamber (under the [[carapace]]) to be used for cleaning the gills.&lt;ref name=&quot;Poore&quot;/&gt; Since this arrangement is very rare in [[Crab|true crabs]] (for example, the small family [[Hexapodidae]]),&lt;ref name=&quot;S&amp;F&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |title=Differentiation of the fossil Hexapodidae Miers, 1886 (Decapoda: Brachyura) from similar forms |author=Carrie E. Schweitzer &amp; Rodney M. Feldmann |journal=[[Journal of Paleontology]] |volume=75 |issue=2 |year=2001 |pages=330–345 |url=http://decapoda.nhm.org/pdfs/10789/10789.pdf|doi=10.1666/0022-3360(2001)075&lt;0330:DOTFHM&gt;2.0.CO;2}}&lt;/ref&gt; a &quot;crab&quot; with only eight visible pereiopods is generally an anomuran.&lt;ref name=&quot;Poore&quot;/&gt;

There is wide acceptance from [[morphology (biology)|morphological]] and [[molecular phylogenetics|molecular]] data that Anomura and [[Brachyura]] (true crabs) are [[sister taxa]], together making up the [[clade]] Meiura.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ahyong&quot;/&gt;

==Classification==
The infraorder Anomura is divided into nine superfamilies:&lt;ref name=&quot;Grave&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |journal = [[Raffles Bulletin of Zoology]] |year=2009 |volume = Suppl. 21 |pages=1–109 |title = A classification of living and fossil genera of decapod crustaceans |author=Sammy De Grave, N.

'''Rock River Arms''', Incorporated is a manufacturing company based in [[Colona, Illinois]] that manufacturers parts and accessories for [[AR-15]]/[[M16 rifle|M16]] type [[rifle]]s, as well as complete firearms.

==Law enforcement use==
In December 2003, after outperforming 10 other manufacturers in rifle abuse tests, Rock River Arms was awarded a contract with the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] for a minimum of 5,000 LAR-15 rifles to be purchased over five years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Petty |first=Charles |month=October |year=2004 |title=And Then There Was One: Feds Select New Fighting Rifle, Rock River's DEA Carbine |journal=Guns Magazine |pages=56–74 |url=http://www.rockriverarms.com/images/pdfs/gm_oct04.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=December 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of Rock River Arms winning the DEA contract, other federal agencies, including the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] and [[United States Marshals]], have also obtained Rock River Arms weapons under piggyback contracts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Oldham |first=Scott |month=January |year=2006 |title=Rock River Arms Entry Tactical |journal=Law and Order |url=http://www.hendonpub.com/resources/article_archive/results/details?id=4138 |accessdate=December 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Company history==
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2011}}
Rock River Arms is owned and operated by brothers Mark and Chuck Larson. Between 1981 and 1991 the Larsons worked at [[Springfield Armory, Inc.]], where Mark was the head armorer. From Springfield Armory, the Larsons went into partnership with Les Baer to form [[Les Baer Custom]] and build custom 1911 pistols. Parting ways with Les Baer in 1993, the Larsons began to build AR-15 type rifles for Eagle Arms in [[Coal Valley, Illinois]]. At around the same time, they began their own venture, Tolerance Plus (the name was later changed to Rock River Arms), producing custom 1911 pistols. The Larson brothers severed their connection with Eagle Arms in 1997 when that firm moved to [[Geneseo, Illinois]]. At the same time, Rock River Arms began to build AR-15 style rifles. For a time, Rock River Arms produced [[M1911]] pattern pistols in addition to rifles, however eventually they dropped that line and now focus their production exclusively on AR-15 pattern rifles.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1667">'''Azzo X d'Este''' (1344–1415) was an [[Italy|Italian]] [[condottiero]], a member of the [[House of Este]].

Born into a cadet branch of the family, he contested the seigniory of [[Ferrara]] to the young [[Niccolò III d'Este|Niccolò III]], an illegitimate son of marquess [[Alberto d'Este]] who was under the protection of [[Pope Benedict IX]] and [[Republic of Venice|Venice]]. After a failed attempt to poison him, Azzo created a ''compagnia'' of mercenaries, with the supports of some Este vassals. However, his invasions of the Ferrara territory was crushed by [[Azzo da Castello]], and he retired to the [[Modena|Modenese]].

With the help of [[Giovanni da Barbiano]] and an army of 8,000 men, in 1395 he tried again the capture of Ferrara, taking advantage of da Castello's death. But he was again heavily defeated at the [[Battle of Portomaggiore]] (April 16), this time by a Venetian army, and imprisoned. Later he was exiled to Candia ([[Crete]]).

He died in Venice in 1415.

'''Pope Victor II''' (c. 1018 – 28 July 1057), born '''Gebhard, Count of Calw, Tollenstein, and Hirschberg''', was [[Pope]] from 1055 to 1057.&lt;ref&gt;Coulombe, Charles A., ''Vicars of Christ: A History of the Popes'', (Citadel Press, 2003), 208.&lt;/ref&gt; He was one of a series of German [[Gregorian Reform|reform]] Popes.

==Life==
He was born Gebhard of [[Calw]], a son of the [[Swabia]]n Count Hartwig of Calw and a kinsman of Emperor [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry III]]. At the insistence of Gebhard, [[bishop of Regensburg|Bishop of Ratisbon]], the 24-year-old Gebhard was appointed [[Bishop of Eichstätt]]. In this position, he supported the Emperor's interests and eventually became one of his closest advisors.

After the death of [[Pope Leo IX]], a Roman delegation headed by Hildebrand, later [[Pope Gregory VII]], travelled to Mainz and asked the Emperor for the nomination of a successor. He suggested Gebhard, who was duly nominated in September 1054. Gebhard, taking the name Victor II, moved to [[Rome]] and was enthroned in [[St. Peter's Basilica]] on 13 April 1055.

In June 1055, Victor met the Emperor at [[Florence]] and held a council, which reinforced [[Pope Leo IX]]'s condemnation of clerical marriage, [[simony]], and the loss of the church's properties. In the following year, he was summoned to the Emperor's side, and was with Henry III when he died at [[Bodfeld]] in the [[Harz]] on 5 October 1056. As guardian of Henry III's infant son [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry]] and adviser of the Empress [[Agnes de Poitou|Agnes]], Henry IV's mother and regent, Victor II now wielded enormous power, which he used to maintain peace throughout the empire and to strengthen the papacy against the aggressions of the barons. He died shortly after his return to Italy, at [[Arezzo]], on 28 July 1057.

Victor II's retinue wished to bring his remains to the cathedral at [[Eichstätt]] for burial. Before they reached the city, however, the remains were seized by some citizens of [[Ravenna]] and buried there in the [[Mausoleum of Theodoric|Church of Santa Maria Rotonda]], the burial place of [[Theodoric the Great]].&lt;ref&gt;Mcbrien, Richard P., ''The Pocket Guide to the Popes'', (HarperCollins, 2006), 166.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although there have been nine German Popes, Victor II is one of only three Popes from the territory of present-day [[Germany]], the others being [[Pope Clement II]] (1046&amp;ndash;47) and [[Pope Benedict XVI|Benedict XVI]] (2005-13).

The '''Non-Resident Violator Compact (NRVC)''' is an [[interstate compact]] used by 44 states in the [[United States]] to process traffic citations across state borders. 

Motorists cited for violations in a state that is not a member of the NRVC must post bail before being allowed to proceed.

When a motorist is cited in another member state and chooses not to respond to the ticket (such as not paying it), the other state notifies the driver's home state and the home state will suspend the driver's license until the driver takes care of the matter in the other state.

There are certain offenses where the Non-Resident Violator Compact does not apply. Those offenses are registration, weight limit, and parking. Some states will not take action on offenses like vehicle equipment and vehicle inspection if their driver has ignored an out of state citation of those offenses. Out of state moving violations are the focus of the compact and there will be no differences in focus under the [[Driver License Agreement]].

==History==

The Non-Resident Violator Compact came into existence in the 1970s, originating from the northeastern states. 

The Non-Resident Violator Compact is being superseded by the new Driver License Agreement (DLA) which also replaces the Driver License Compact. As planned by the DLC-NRVC Executive Board, when the Driver License Agreement is ratified by Non-Resident Violator Compact members, it will no longer be relevant.

==States that are members==
* All states plus the [[District of Columbia]] are members except [[Michigan]], [[Wisconsin]], [[California]], [[Montana]], [[Oregon]], and [[Alaska]].&lt;ref name=&quot;states&quot;&gt;[http://www.aamva.org/uploadedFiles/MainSite/Content/DriverLicensingIdentification/DL_ID_Compacts/Compact%20Member%20Joinder%20Dates.pdf http://www.aamva.org/uploadedFiles/MainSite/Content/DriverLicensingIdentification/DL_ID_Compacts/Compact%20Member%20Joinder%20Dates.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notes==
* Most states where a citation is issued will suspend your license in that state while you maintain the right to drive in your home state that is not a member of the NRVC
* Most states will also issue a warrant for your arrest as well as sending the suspension request to your home state.
* If you are traveling through NRVC member states, and you are licensed in one of the non-member states, it may be a good idea to carry enough cash to pay bond for any traffic violations you are stopped for and required to pay before leaving.
* Being required to pay bond roadside is NOT a plea of guilt.  You may appear in court on the date indicated on your citation, and if found not-guilty, should have the bond refunded.

Also see &quot;http://www.aamva.org/KnowledgeCenter/Driver/Compacts/&quot; Driver License Compacts: Jurisdictional Agreements, which has links to the procedures documents.   Note: The governing body for the NRVC is the DLC-NRVC Executive Board, made up of U.S. State and Canadian Provincial DMV officials elected by the State and Provincial representatives.  AAMVA, as the secretariat for the DLC-NRVC Executive Board, provides administrative secretarial services to the Board. --&gt;

==Plot==
The dangerous desert planet Androzani Minor is the only source for a powerful drug called spectrox created by bats that inhabit the planet's caves. Spectrox is highly valued by the population of nearby Androzani Major due to its capacity to extend one's life. The spectrox mining interests are controlled by Trau Morgus, a business conglomerate leader on Androzani Major, but the operation has been threatened by the masked Sharaz Jek and his army of androids, causing public tension on Androzani Major due to limited supplies. Morgus has publicly funded a military operation by the Androzani Major's government against Jek's androids, but at the same time has secretly backed a gunrunning group to deliver weapons to Jek to profit from the war.

The [[TARDIS]] lands on Androzani Minor, and the Doctor and Peri decide to explore a set of tracks that lead into a nearby cave. As they explore, they are briefly caught in a ball of an unknown sticky substance, but they easily break free. Further into the caves, they discover a hoard of weapons, but are then captured by General Chellak's forces, believing the two to be working for gunrunners Stotz and Krepler. Morgus orders their execution after seeing that Chellak's &quot;gunrunners&quot; are not his own men over holographic communication. When the two are brought to the execution squad, they are found to be androids, as the Doctor and Peri have since been rescued by Jek who had been watching the two enter the caves and was able to prepare duplicate androids with help of his personal android Salateen.

At Jek's base, the two complain about rashes and cramps in their bodies where they touched the sticky substances, Salateen (also a prisoner) realises they have been subjected to the first stages of spectrox [[toxemia]] from exposure to unrefined spectrox, and that while there is an anti-toxin, it requires the milk of the queen bat. Unfortunately, due to the mining activity, all the bats have migrated to deeper levels of the caves where there is no oxygen. Before leaving to meet with the gunrunners while leaving the two under his androids' guard, Jek explains that he is seeking revenge against Morgus as it was his actions that left his face disfigured. After Jek leaves, the Doctor is able to reprogram the androids and allows for him and Peri to escape, but they quickly encounter Chellak's forces; Peri is recaptured while the Doctor is caught by Stotz. Stotz decides to take the Doctor back to Androzani Major to see Morgus directly. As Stotz discusses the situation with Morgus via holographic communication ''en route'', Morgus sees the Doctor still alive, and fearing deception, kills the President of Androzani Major and makes his own plans to travel to Androzani Minor to put the situation right himself. The Doctor is able to gain control of the ship from Stotz and crashes it back on the surface of Androzani Minor; weary from the spectrox poisoning, he makes his way into the caves to try to save Peri.

Meanwhile, Chellak plans an assault on Jek's base, luring him to believe an attack lies elsewhere. The battle kills nearly all of the military forces including Chellak, the gunruners, and Jek's androids; Jek is able to rescue the unconscious Peri from the military base and return her to his base amid the chaos. The Doctor arrives, struggling to hold off his body's attempt to regenerate to rid itself of the spectrox. Jek provides him with a limited air supply and equipment and directions to find and milk the queen bat. As the Doctor departs to get the milk, Morgus arrives on the planet, finding that his shrewd secretary has deposed him from power. Morgus quickly deals with Stotz to kill all the remaining gunrunners, including Krepler, and then plot to secure Jek's private stash of spectrox so they may disappear quietly to another planet. The two make their way to Jek's base, lured by fans that Jek is using to try to keep the base temperature cool for Peri. A brief fight breaks out, and Jek, Morgus, and Stotz are killed. The Doctor arrives just after the battle and takes Peri back to the TARDIS on the surface as the planet erupts around them. While unlocking the TARDIS, the Doctor accidentally spills some of the bat's milk.

Inside the TARDIS, the Doctor gives Peri the remaining bat's milk and collapses. Peri quickly recovers and finds him lying in pain on the floor. The Doctor explains that there was only enough bat's milk left to cure her, but his body will shortly regenerate, though it feels different from his previous regenerations. The Doctor begins to hallucinate images of his past Companions urging him to continue to fight for his life, followed by [[Master (Doctor Who)|The Master]] laughing at his state. The Doctor says '[[Adric]]' before the regeneration completes, with the [[Sixth Doctor|Doctor]] suddenly alert and active though with a new face. When Peri asks what is happening, the Doctor replies, ''&quot;Change, my  dear, [[The Twin Dilemma|and it seems not a moment too soon...&quot;]]''

===Continuity===
This story was the last to feature Peter Davison as the current Doctor. Davison would reprise the role of the Fifth Doctor for two charity specials: ''[[Dimensions in Time]]'' (1993), and ''[[Time Crash]]'' (2007). ''The Caves of Androzani'' remains Davison's favourite story from his era; and he has said in interviews that if there had been more scripts like ''Caves'' during his era, he might have been persuaded to stay for a fourth season.

An explanation was finally given to the question as to why the [[Fifth Doctor]] wore a stick of [[List of Doctor Who items#C|celery]] on his lapel since ''[[Castrovalva (Doctor Who)|Castrovalva]]'' (1982). His incarnation of the Doctor was allergic to certain gases in the &quot;Praxis&quot; range, which would turn the celery purple if it came into contact with them. The Doctor would then eat the celery. This allergy did not appear to be one shared by any incarnation prior to or since Davison. In reality, Davison requested that an explanation be given in his final story and [[Eric Saward]] worked an explanation into the final script.

A much more intimate version of the events at the end of this story is revealed at the end of the [[Big Finish Productions|Big Finish]] audio story ''[[Circular Time]]'' (2007).

The working title of this story was ''Chain Reaction''. This story was the first time former [[script editor]] Robert Holmes had written for the series since ''[[The Power of Kroll]]'' (1978), as Nathan-Turner had been keen to use writers new to the show instead.

Recording was interrupted by industrial action, which caused a serious delay in the filming of the serial. As a result, two sequences had to be cut. The first scene would have featured the Doctor and Peri at the opening of the story in the TARDIS. The Doctor was to explain to Peri the reason for their visit to Androzani Minor. Apparently, as a boy, the Doctor had started a &quot;blown glass bottle collection,&quot; which was made from the sand of different planets. He had lost his Androzani bottle and decided to return there to retrieve some more [[sand]]. It was in this scene Peri was to say &quot;You're such a pain, Doctor.&quot; However, when the final cut of the serial was made, it had been discovered that certain lines of dialogue (like the Doctor professing that &quot;I am not a pain.&quot; and Peri's comments about needing sand to &quot;make some glass&quot;) alluded to the cut sequence. To rectify this, Davison and Bryant voiced over part of their conversation while the TARDIS materialises from outer space to the planet. The second scene to be cut would have featured the Doctor battling with the magma beast in episode four. Other ''Doctor Who'' stories adversely affected by the industrial actions of the late 1970s and the 1980s were ''[[Resurrection of the Daleks]]'' (1984), which was delayed by a year, and ''[[Shada]]'' (1980), which was not completed.

While he is in his office, the character of Morgus frequently [[Fourth wall|breaks the fourth wall]] by talking directly to camera. This arose through actor John Normington misunderstanding a stage direction.&lt;ref&gt;Doctor Who Magazine #279, 30th June 1999, Archive: The Caves Of Androzani by Andrew Pixley, Marvel Comics UK Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt; The Fifth Doctor's regeneration, like the [[Fourth Doctor]]'s, features a flashback of that incarnation's companions. However, for this regeneration, it was decided that special recordings of the Davison-era companions would be used instead of stock footage. This required [[Matthew Waterhouse]], [[Sarah Sutton]], [[Janet Fielding]], [[Mark Strickson]], [[Gerald Flood]] and [[Anthony Ainley]] to return in cameos for the regeneration sequence. Fielding, Strickson, Flood and Ainley were already under contract to appear in the stories of Season 21. However, special contracts had to be made for Waterhouse, who left the series in Season 19, and Sutton, who left in Season 20. [[Johnny Byrne (writer)|Johnny Byrne]], who created the character of Nyssa (in his 1981 story ''[[The Keeper of Traken]]'') had to be paid royalties for the use of the character in the regeneration scene.

Davison has joked on several occasions of how he was &quot;upstaged&quot; by Nicola Bryant (Peri) in his last major scene as the Doctor{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}. Before the regeneration hallucination occurs, Davison is lying on the floor and his head is resting by Bryant, who is kneeling beside him. As he is delivering his last few lines, Bryant's loose fitting outfit prominently displays her cleavage. The closing title sequence for episode four featured the face of [[Sixth Doctor]] [[Colin Baker]] instead of Peter Davison, and credits Baker as the Doctor before Davison's own credit. This was the first and, to date, only time that the new lead received top billing in the final story of an outgoing Doctor. The trousers Colin Baker wore in the regeneration scene were modified to fit his larger frame. Davison would later wear the same trousers when he reprised the role of the Fifth Doctor in the mini-episode [[Time Crash]]&lt;ref&gt;Doctor Who Confidential&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cast notes===
Christopher Gable, who played Sharaz Jek, was a well-known dancer. Gable was not the only contender to play Jek; John Nathan-Turner, who always favoured attracting big stars to the series in guest roles, had offered the role to [[Tim Curry]], [[Mick Jagger]] and then to [[David Bowie]]. Ultimately, Christopher Gable was cast, the preferred choice of director Graeme Harper (Harper claimed on the DVD commentary that Bowie was the only other contender he thought of but he believed Gable ended up being right for it). Robert Glenister and Peter Davison had previously played brothers Brian and Steve Webber in the BBC [[sitcom]] ''[[Sink or Swim (TV)|Sink or Swim]]'' (1980–82). Glenister later played Aboresh in the audio play ''[[Absolution (audio drama)|Absolution]]''. John Normington guest stars as Morgus; he returned to the series as Trevor Sigma in the [[Seventh Doctor]] story ''[[The Happiness Patrol]]'' (1988). He also appeared in &quot;[[Ghost Machine (Torchwood)|Ghost Machine]]&quot; (2006), an episode of the ''Doctor Who'' spin-off ''[[Torchwood]]''.

==Broadcast and reception==
The serial was repeated on BBC 2 in February/March 1993 on consecutive Fridays (19/2/1993 to 12/3/1993) at 7.15pm. This story was released on [[VHS]] in January 1992.

Peter Davison has stated that this is his favourite serial from his three years on the series.  He has stated that he particularly enjoyed the script by [[Robert Holmes (scriptwriter)|Robert Holmes]] and working with the director [[Graeme Harper]]. In 2003's 40th Anniversary ''[[Doctor Who Magazine]]'' poll, ''The Caves of Androzani'' was voted the best serial of all time. In [[Outpost Gallifrey]]'s 40th Anniversary Poll, ''The Caves of Androzani'' was voted the second best serial of all time. In a 2009 ''Doctor Who Magazine'' poll, ''The Caves of Androzani'' was voted the greatest ''Doctor Who'' story by readers, ahead of &quot;[[Blink (Doctor Who)|Blink]]&quot; and ''[[Genesis of the Daleks]]''. It was the only Peter Davison story to feature in the top ten ([[Tom Baker]] had 5 entries while [[Christopher Eccleston]] and [[David Tennant]] had 2 each).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Kirsty |last=Cameron |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/doctor-who/6199603/Doctor-Who-Top-10-fans-vote-for-all-time-best-episode.html |title=Doctor Who Top 10: fans vote for all-time best episode |publisher=Telegraph.co.uk |date=16 September 2009 |accessdate=2013-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Curtiss Model 22 Cox Racer'''s were two specialised [[Air racing|racing aircraft]] built by the [[United States|American]] [[Curtiss Aeroplane and Motor Company]]. The type was flown as a [[monoplane]], [[biplane]] and [[triplane]]. 

==Design and development==
In 1920 the American oil millionaire S.Cox had two specialised racing monoplanes built for him by the [[Curtiss Aeroplane and Motor Company]] to take part in the [[Gordon Bennett Trophy (aeroplanes)|Gordon Bennett Trophy]] race to be held in France in September 1920.&lt;ref name=&quot;orbis&quot; /&gt; The two aircraft, named ''Texas Wildcat'' and ''Cactus Kitten'', were single-engined, braced, high-wing monoplanes powered by a {{convert|427|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} [[Curtiss C-12]] inline piston engine.&lt;ref name=&quot;orbis&quot; /&gt; They had streamlined wooden fuselages with the pilot sitting in an enclosed cockpit towards the rear of the fuselage, under a forward sliding canopy. The wing, which had a special double [[Camber (aerodynamics)|camber]] [[airfoil]] section,  was high-mounted, and was braced by struts to the mainwheels of the fixed [[conventional landing gear]]. The V-12 engine drove a two-bladed [[tractor configuration|tractor]] propeller, and was cooled by radiators mounted on the side of the fuselage between the cockpit and the wings.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bowers Curtiss p224-5&quot;&gt;Bowers 1979, pp. 224–225.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operational history==
The ''Texas Wildcat'' was briefly tested in the United States before shipment, being fitted with a different wing with a more conventional airfoil for operation out of the confined [[Roosevelt Field, New York|Curtiss Field]]. First flying on July 25, it demonstrated a speed of {{convert|183|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}, with a speed of {{convert|215|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} expected when fitted with the high speed racing wing. Both aircraft were then sent by ship to France, with no testing carried out on the high speed wing and ''Cactus Kitten'' unflown before sailing.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bowers Curtiss p224-5&quot;/&gt; ''Texas Wildcat'' was re-assembled at the [[Morane-Saulnier]] factory with the high speed wing, but was found to be unstable at high speeds when flown by test pilot [[Roland Rohlfs]]. A set of [[biplane]] wings were therefore quickly designed and fitted to ''Texas Wildcat''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bowers Curtiss p225&quot;&gt;Bowers 1979, p. 225.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;orbis&quot; /&gt; ''Texas Wildcat'' was wrecked in a landing accident when being flown to [[Étampes]] prior to the race.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bowers Curtiss p226&quot;&gt;Bowers 1979, p. 226.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;orbis&quot; /&gt;

Although the ''Cactus Kitten'' was taken to France it remained unflown and was returned to the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;orbis&quot; /&gt; It was then rebuilt with a set of short-span [[triplane]] wings modified from those of a [[Curtiss 18|Curtiss 18T]], with the enclosed cockpit replaced by a more conventional open cockpit. Thus modified, it was entered into the 1921 [[National Air Races|Pulitzer Trophy Race]], where, flown by Clarence Coombs at an average speed of {{convert|170.3|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}, it gained second place behind a [[Curtiss CR]] piloted by [[Bert Acosta]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Bowers Curtiss p226&quot;&gt;Bowers 1979, p. 226.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;flight 21 p805&quot;&gt;''Flight'' December 1 1921, p. 805.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;orbis&quot; /&gt; It was later sold to the [[United States Navy]] as a trainer for high-speed racing aircraft.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bowers Curtiss p228&quot;&gt;Bowers 1979, p. 228.&lt;/ref&gt;

==American Samoa Fono==
Voters elected twenty members to the [[American Samoa House of Representatives]].&lt;ref name=rnzi/&gt;

==Delegate to the U.S. House of Representatives==
{{Main|United States House of Representatives election in American Samoa, 2012}}
Voters will also choose American Samoa's delegate to the [[United States House of Representatives]], who holds office for a two year term.  Incumbent [[Eni Faleomavaega]] won re-election to a 113th, two-year term.

==Referendum==
Voters were asked &quot;Should Article II, Sections 9 and 19 of the revised constitution of American Samoa be revised to give the Fono, rather than the Secretary for the U.S. Department of Interior, the power to override the Governors veto?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://americansamoaelectionoffice.org/2012-amendment-revised-constitution 2012 Amendment to the Revised Constitution] American Samoa Government Election Office&lt;/ref&gt;

The proposal would involve amending two parts of the constitution:

The '''Matteson M-1''' was an [[United States|American]] [[high-wing]], single-seat, [[FAI Open Class]] [[Glider (sailplane)|glider]] that was designed and built by [[Fred Matteson]] of [[Palo Alto, California]] and [[Alfred Vogt (glider designer)|Alfred Vogt]] of [[Schempp-Hirth]].&lt;ref name=&quot;SoaringNov83&quot;&gt;Said, Bob: ''1983 Sailplane Directory, [[Soaring Magazine]]'', page 48. [[Soaring Society of America]] November 1983. USPS 499-920&lt;/ref&gt;
==Design and development==
Work on the M-1 started in 1955 at the Schempp-Hirth factory, while Matteson was on military duty in [[West Germany]]. The design that Matteson had conceived was adapted to German metric standards and materials by Alfred Vogt who did the early construction work. After being posted back to the United States Matteson completed the aircraft in 1959 in California.&lt;ref name=&quot;SoaringNov83&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SH&quot;&gt; {{Cite web|url = http://www.schempp-hirth.com/index.php?id=75&amp;L=1|title = From &quot;Wolf&quot; to &quot;Discus-2&quot;|accessdate = 28 May 2011|last = [[Schempp-Hirth|Schempp-Hirth Flugzeugbau GmbH]]|authorlink = |year = 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Vintage&quot;&gt; {{Cite web|url = http://vintagesailplanes.de/M1.htm|title = Matteson M-1 Wellensrgler |accessdate = 28 May 2011|last = Hennig|first = Günther|authorlink = |year = 2011|month = May}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The M-1 was built from wood and covered with doped [[aircraft fabric covering]]. The semi-tapered wing was of {{convert|51|ft|m|1|abbr=on}} span and used a [[NACA]] 63-518 [[wing root]] [[airfoil]], transitioning to a NACA 4412 airfoil at the [[wing tip]]. The three-piece wing, with a fixed center section and removable tips, featured a foam-filled [[leading edge]] and large-sized lower surface [[dive brakes]]. The aircraft had a conventional tail with a tall, straight vertical fin. The M-1 used a take-off dolly, landing on a fixed skid.&lt;ref name=&quot;SoaringNov83&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Incomplete&quot;&gt; {{Cite web|url = http://www.ae.illinois.edu/m-selig/ads/aircraft.html|title = The Incomplete Guide to Airfoil Usage |accessdate = 28 May 2011|last = Lednicer |first = David |authorlink = |year = 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Only one M-1 was ever built.&lt;ref name=&quot;SoaringNov83&quot; /&gt;

==Operational history==
Matteson later sold the completed aircraft and subsequent owners included Dr Gary Grant of [[Yuba City, California]], Robert R. Kirby of [[Santa Ynez, California]] and Ron Tabery of [[Austin Texas]].&lt;ref name=&quot;SoaringNov83&quot; /&gt;

Kirby described the aircraft: &quot;I have flown the ship and it is a very fine machine. Its drawbacks are difficult assembly and a poor landing gear system.&quot; While he owned it Kirby modified the aircraft to try to address some of the noted deficiencies.&lt;ref name=&quot;SoaringNov83&quot; /&gt;

The M-1 is no longer on the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] aircraft registry and its registration has been reassigned. It was reported that the aircraft was likely written off.&lt;ref name=&quot;FAAReg&quot;&gt; {{Cite web|url = http://registry.faa.gov/aircraftinquiry/NNum_Results.aspx?NNumbertxt=6716C|title = Make / Model Inquiry Results|accessdate = 15 May 2011|last = [[Federal Aviation Administration]]|authorlink = |year = 2011|month =May}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;m1&quot;&gt; {{Cite web|url = http://www.aviationbanter.com/showthread.php?t=42676|title = Where is the Matteson M-1?|accessdate = 29 May 2011|last = Startup|first = Pete|authorlink = |year = 2006|month = November}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''General elections''' were held in the [[Netherlands]] on 5 July 1922.&lt;ref name=NS&gt;[[Dieter Nohlen|Nohlen, D]] &amp; Stöver, P (2010) ''Elections in Europe: A data handbook'', p1395 ISBN 978-3-8329-5609-7&lt;/ref&gt; They were the first elections held under [[universal suffrage]], which became reality after the acceptance of a proposal by [[Henri Marchant]] in 1919 that gave women full voting rights.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rug.nl/dnpp/verkiezingen/2ekamer/campagne/22 1922 parliamentary election campaign] University of Gronigen&lt;/ref&gt; Almost all major parties had a woman elected. The number of female representatives increased from one to seven. Only the ARP principally excluded women from the House of Representatives. Another amendment to the electoral law increased the [[electoral threshold]] from 0.5% to 0.75%,&lt;ref&gt;Nohlen &amp; Stöver, p1385&lt;/ref&gt; after six parties had won seats with less than 0.75% of the vote in the [[Dutch general election, 1918|previous elections]].

The [[General League of Roman Catholic Caucuses]] remained the largest party, increasing from 30 to 32 seats, whilst the [[Anti Revolutionary Party]] increased from 13 to 16 seats, and the [[Christian Historical Union]] went from 7 to 11 seats.&lt;ref name=N1&gt;Nohlen &amp; Stöver, p1412&lt;/ref&gt; The right-wing [[Christian Democratic Party (Netherlands)|Christian Democratic Party]] and the [[Christian Social Party (Netherlands)|Christian Social Party]] both lost their sole seats, disappearing from the House, while the [[Reformed Political Party]] (SGP) managed to win a seat. The SGP, an orthodox Protestant party established in 1918, was opposed to the co-operation of the Protestant ARP and CHU with the Catholics.

The [[Social Democratic Workers' Party (Netherlands)|Social Democratic Workers' Party]] lost two seats,&lt;ref name=N1/&gt; whilst left-wing splinter parties also suffered losses, and went from four to two seats.

Several liberal groups had merged in 1921 to form the [[Liberal State Party]], but lost further seats as they were reduced from fifteen to only ten. However, a new [[Liberal Party (Netherlands)|Liberal Party]] led by the 85-year-old [[Samuel van Houten]], won a seat. Van Houten himself did not take the seat, which was instead occupied by his representative, [[Lizzy van Dorp]].

The [[Free-thinking Democratic League]] maintained, against most expectations, their five seats, whilst of the remaining splinter parties, only the [[Peasants' League]] was able to survive, rising from one to two seats. 

After a relatively short formation, the [[second Ruijs de Beerenbrouck cabinet]] was formed, with largely the same composition as the [[Second Ruijs de Beerenbrouck cabinet|previous one]].

{{Nihongo|'''Emperor Go-Ichijō'''|後一条天皇|Go-Ichijō-[[tennō]]|October 12, 1008 – May 15, 1036}} was the 68th [[emperor]] of [[Japan]],&lt;ref name=&quot;kunaicho&quot;&gt;[[Imperial Household Agency]] (''Kunaichō''): [http://www.kunaicho.go.jp/ryobo/guide/068/index.html  後一条天皇 (68)]&lt;/ref&gt; according to the traditional [[List of Emperors of Japan|order of succession]].&lt;ref&gt;Ponsonby-Fane, Richard. (1959). ''The Imperial House of Japan,'' p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt;

Go-Ichijō's reign spanned the years from 1016 through 1036.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Delmer ''et al.'' (1979). ''Gukanshō,'' pp. 307–310; Varley, H. Paul. (1980). ''Jinnō Shōtōki.'' p. 195-196; Titsingh, Isaac. (1834). {{Google books|18oNAAAAIAAJ|''Annales des empereurs du Japon,'' pp. 156–159.|page=156}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This 11th century sovereign was named after [[Emperor Ichijō]] and ''go-'' (後), translates literally as &quot;later;&quot; and thus, he is sometimes called the &quot;Later Emperor Ichijō&quot;. The Japanese word &quot;''go''&quot; has also been translated to mean the &quot;second one;&quot; and in some older sources, this emperor may be identified as &quot;Ichijō, the second.&quot;

==Traditional narrative==
Before his ascension to the [[Chrysanthemum Throne]], his personal name (''[[imina]]'')&lt;ref&gt;Brown, pp. 264; prior to [[Emperor Jomei]], the personal names of the emperors were very long and people did not generally use them.  The number of characters in each name diminished after Jomei's reign.&lt;/ref&gt; was Atsuhira''-shinnō'' (敦成親王).&lt;ref&gt;Varley, p. 195&lt;/ref&gt;  He was also known as Atsunari''-shinnō''.&lt;ref&gt;Titsingh, p. 156; Brown, p. 307.&lt;/ref&gt;

Atsuhira was the second son of [[Emperor Ichijō]].  His mother, Fujiwara no Akiko/[[Empress Shōshi|Shōshi]] (藤原彰子) (988–1074), was a daughter of [[Fujiwara no Michinaga]]. In her later years, Ichijō's ''chūgo'' consort was known as Jōtō-mon In (上東門院).&lt;ref&gt;Titsingh, p. 156; Brown, p. 309.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Events of Go-Ichijō's life===
Atsuhira''-shinnō'' was used as a pawn in Imperial court politics when he was only a child.

* '''1012''' (''[[Chōwa]] 1, 8th month''): Prince Atsuhira marries a daughter of ''sesshō'' and later ''kampaku'' [[Fujiwara no Michinaga]].&lt;ref&gt;Titsingh, p. 154.&lt;/ref&gt;

Atsuhira became emperor at the age of 8, upon the abdication of his [[first cousin once removed]], [[Emperor Sanjō]].

* '''March 10, 1016''' (''Chōwa 5, 29th day of the 1st month'')&lt;!-- [http://web.me.com/meyer.eva/www.yukikurete.de/nengo_calc.htm  NengoCalc] 長和五年一月二十九日  --&gt;: In the 5th year of Emperor Sanjō's reign (三条天皇5年), he abdicated; and the succession (‘‘senso’’) was received by a cousin.  Shortly thereafter, Emperor Go-Ichijō is said to have acceded to the throne (‘‘sokui’’).&lt;ref&gt;Titsingh, pp. 155–156; Brown, p. 307; Varley, p. 44; a distinct act of ''senso'' is unrecognized prior to [[Emperor Tenji]]; and all sovereigns except [[Empress Jitō|Jitō]], [[Emperor Yōzei|Yōzei]], [[Emperor Go-Toba|Go-Toba]], and [[Emperor Fushimi|Fushimi]] have ''senso'' and ''sokui'' in the same year until the reign of [[Emperor Go-Murakami]].&lt;/ref&gt;

During the initial years of Go-Ichijō's reign, [[Fujiwara no Michinaga]] actually ruled from his position as ''[[sesshō]]'' ([[regent]]).&lt;ref&gt;Brown, pp. 308–309; Varley, p. 195.&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''June 5, 1017''' (''[[Kannin]] 1, 9th day of the 5th month'')&lt;!-- 寛仁一年五月九日 --&gt;: The former-Emperor Sanjō died at the age of 41.&lt;ref name=&quot;b310&quot; /&gt;
* '''1017''' (''Kannin 1, 8th month''): Prince Atsuakira, the eldest son of Emperor Sanjo, had been named Crown Prince.  But after he is struck by a skin disease and intense pressure from Michinaga; he withdrew from this role and his younger brother, Prince Atsunaga, was named Crown Prince in his place.&lt;ref&gt;Titsingh, p. 156.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''1017''' (''Kannin 1, 9th month''): Michinaga made a pilgrimage to the [[Iwashimizu Shrine]] accompanied by many courtiers.  The travelers divided themselves amongst 15 boats for a floating trip down the Yotogawa River.  One of the vessels overturned, and more than 30 people lost their lives.&lt;ref name=&quot;t157&quot;&gt;Titsingh, p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''1017''' (''Kannin 1, 12th month''): Michinaga was elevated to the office of ''Daijō-Diajin''.&lt;ref name=&quot;t157&quot; /&gt;

* '''May 15, 1036''' (''[[Chōgen]] 9, 17th day of the 4th month'')&lt;!-- 長元九年四月十七日 --&gt;: Emperor Go-Ichijō died at the age of 29.&lt;ref name=&quot;b310&quot; /&gt;

The actual site of Go-Ichijō's [[grave (burial)|grave]] is known.&lt;ref name=&quot;kunaicho&quot;/&gt;  This emperor is traditionally venerated at a [[memorial]] [[Shinto]] [[shrine]] (''misasagi'') at Kyoto.

The [[Imperial Household Agency]] designates this location as Go-Ichijō's [[mausoleum]].  It is formally named ''Bodaijuin no misasagi''.&lt;ref&gt;Ponsonby-Fane, p. 421.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kugyō===
{{Nihongo|''[[Kugyō]]''|公卿}} is a collective term for the very few most powerful men attached to the court of the [[Emperor of Japan]] in pre-[[Meiji period|Meiji]] eras. Even during those years in which the court's actual influence outside the palace walls was minimal, the hierarchic organization persisted.

In general, this elite group included only three to four men at a time.  These were hereditary courtiers whose experience and background would have brought them to the pinnacle of a life's career.  During Go-Ichijō's reign, this apex of the ''[[Daijō-kan]] included:
* ''[[Sesshō]]'', [[Fujiwara Michinaga]], 966–1027.&lt;ref name=&quot;b308-309&quot;&gt;Brown, p. 308-309.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Sesshō]]'', [[Fujiwara Yorimichi]], 992–1074.&lt;ref name=&quot;b309&quot;&gt;Brown, p. 309.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Kampaku]]'', Fujiwara Yorimichi.&lt;ref name=&quot;b309&quot;&gt;Brown, p. 309.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Daijō-daijin]]'', Fujiwara Michinaga.&lt;ref name=&quot;b308-309&quot; /&gt;
* ''[[Daijō-daijin]]'', Kan'in Kinsue, 956–1029.&lt;ref name=&quot;b309&quot; /&gt;
* ''[[Sadaijin]]'', Fujiwara Michinaga.&lt;ref name=&quot;b308-309&quot; /&gt;
* ''[[Sadaijin]]'', Fujiwara Akimitsu, 944–1021.&lt;ref name=&quot;b309&quot; /&gt;
* ''[[Sadaijin]]'', Fujiwara Yorimichi.&lt;ref name=&quot;b309&quot; /&gt;
* ''[[Udaijin]]'', Fujiwara Sanesuke, 957–1046.&lt;ref name=&quot;b309&quot; /&gt;
* ''[[Nadaijin]]'', Fujiwara Norimichi, 997–1075.&lt;ref name=&quot;b309&quot; /&gt;
* ''[[Dainagon]]''

==Eras of Go-Ichijō's reign==
The years of Go-Ichijō's reign are more specifically identified by more than one [[Japanese era names|era name]] or ''[[nengō]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Titsingh, p. 156-159; Brown, p. 310.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Penola Catholic College''' (also known as PCC or simply Penola) is a co-educational secondary college, located in [[Melbourne]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[Australia]]. The Patron of the college is [[Mary MacKillop]]. It has two campuses: one located at [[Glenroy]] which is commonly known as the junior campus for Years 7 and 8 students; and the other, the main campus, in [[Broadmeadows]] for the Years 9 to 12 students.

==History==
Penola Catholic College is the result of the amalgamation in 1995 of three Catholic secondary schools - Therry College, Geoghegan College and Sancta Sophia College.

The site of Therry and Geoghegan Colleges now is the home to the Penola's senior campus (Years 9-12) which is located in Gibson Street, Broadmeadows.

The junior campus of Penola (Year 7-8) is located on the original site of Sancta Sophia College in Glenroy.

===College Emblem===
The three leaves symbolise the spiritual, physical and intellectual growth potential of the members of the College community and also represent the three Colleges from which Penola Catholic College has sprung. The trunk of the tree is represented by the cross and points to the life of Christ as a model for the members of Penola Catholic College. The tree reminds us of the aboriginal origins of the name Penola, which means stringybark. The name Penola provides a unifying canopy of care, protection, and security for the members of the College community.

===College Name===
The College name, Penola Catholic College, was chosen because of the strong link of our Broadmeadows campus with Saint Mary MacKillop and the Sisters of St Joseph who established a foundling home on this site in 1901. Penola, a small town in the south-east of South Australia, is where Mary MacKillop opened her first school in 1866 and where together with Fr Julian Tenison Woods she founded the order of the Sisters of St Joseph of the Sacred Heart. The Sisters of St Joseph ministered to the local community and lived on this site from 1901 until the late 1980’s.

==Houses==
The College operates a House Group system. Students are divided into six House Groups for the duration of their enrolment at the College. Students compete for House points in activities such as sport, debating and other extra curricular activities.

The six  House Groups are:
* '''Mackillop''' - Named after [[Mary MacKillop]], the College's patron and is represented by the colour orange.
* '''Nolan''' - Named after Sister Livinus Nolan, long serving Victorian Catholic school educator and member of the Sisters of St.Joseph. Nolan is represented by the colour purple.
* '''Geoghegan''' - Named after one of three colleges amalgamated to form the College, and is represented by the colour green.
* '''Smyth''' - Named after Thomas Smyth, founding Principal of Penola Catholic College and is represented by the colour blue.
* '''Therry''' - Named after one of three colleges amalgamated to form the College and is represented by the colour gold.
* '''Sancta Sophia''' - Named after one of three colleges amalgamated to form the College and is represented by the colour red.

'''Stalybridge and Hyde''' is a [[county constituency]] represented in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]]. It elects one [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) by the [[first past the post]] system of election.

== Boundaries ==

The constituency covers the areas of the former [[municipal borough]]s of [[Stalybridge]], [[Hyde, Greater Manchester|Hyde]] and [[Mossley]], as well as the former [[Urban district (Great Britain and Ireland)|urban districts]] of [[Hollingworth]] and [[Mottram in Longdendale]]. Until 1997 it also included the area of the former municipal borough of Dukinfield, most of which now forms part of the [[Denton and Reddish (UK Parliament constituency)|Denton and Reddish]] constituency.

It is made up of the following Tameside Borough Council electoral wards, almost completely unchanged from the 1983 general election&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Crewe|first=Ivor|title=British Parliamentary Constituencies - a statistical compendium|year=1983|publisher=faber and faber|isbn=0-571-13236-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

* [[Dukinfield]] [[Stalybridge]], [[Hyde, Greater Manchester|Hyde]] Godley, Hyde Newton, Hyde Werneth, [[Longdendale]], Mossley, [[Stalybridge]] North, Stalybridge South.

===Proposed changes===

As part of the [[Sixth Periodic Review of Westminster constituencies]] which began in 2011 the Boundary Commission for England proposed expanding the seat&lt;ref&gt;[http://assets.boundarycommissionforengland.independent.gov.uk/proposals/141%20Greater%20Manchester/Stalybridge%20and%20Hyde%20CC.pdf Proposed map - Stalybridge and Hyde] Boundary Commission for England&lt;/ref&gt; to incorporate Dukinfield as was the case in 1983.

== History ==

The constituency is a largely working-class area, and is a [[safe seat]] for [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]], which has held it since the [[United Kingdom general election, 1945|1945 general election]].

'''Sant Joan''' (official name; english: '''Saint John''') is a municipality on [[Majorca]], [[Spain]], situated in the center of the island in the [[Comarcas of Spain|comarca]] of [[Pla de Mallorca]]. The town Sant Joan, formerly known as Sant Joan de Sineu, was founded in 1300. It is bordered by the municipalities of [[Petra, Balearic Islands|Petra]], [[Villafranca de Bonany]], [[Porreres]], [[Montuïri]], [[Lloret de Vistalegre]], and [[Sineu]].

'''Guangdong music''', also known as ''[[Cantonese music]]'' (广东音乐 ''Guǎngdōng yīnyuè'') is a style of traditional Chinese instrumental music from [[Guangzhou]] and surrounding areas in [[Pearl River Delta ]] of Guangdong Province on the southern coast of China. The name of the music is not an accurate description because ''Guangdong music'' is not the only music of the whole Guangdong area. In Guangdong, there are numerous traditional [[genres]] of music such as [[Teochew music]] and [[Hakka music]] (Hakka ''Hanyue'' and ''sixian''). The name of the music originated in the 1920 and 1930s when the music was popular in [[Shanghai]] ballrooms in the form of &quot;Spiritual Music&quot; ([[wikt:精神音樂|精神音樂]], Jīngshěn Yīnyuè; more properly translated as &quot;spirited music&quot;). As the performers were almost entirely from Guangdong, Shanghai people generalized the form of music as Guangdong music. Musically, compositions are based on tunes derived from ''Yueju'' ([[Cantonese opera]]), together with new compositions from the 1920s onwards. Some pieces have influences from [[jazz]] and Western music, using [[syncopation]] and triple time, and incorporating instruments such as the [[saxophone]], [[violin]], [[guitar]], [[piano]], [[drum set]], or [[xylophone]].

==Instrumentation==
The ''[[gaohu]]'' is the most common lead instrument used in performing Cantonese music. It was invented by [[Lü Wencheng]] (吕文成, 1898-1981) in the 1920s. Prior to this, the ''[[erxian]]'' was the most common lead bowed string instrument in the Cantonese ensemble. Ensembles led by the ''erxian'' and also featuring the ''tiqin'' are called ''yinggong'' (硬弓, literally &quot;hard bow&quot;) ensembles, while those led by the ''gaohu'' are called ''ruangong'' (软弓, literally &quot;soft bow&quot;) because the ''erxian'' and ''tiqin'' have thick bamboo bows, while the ''gaohu'' has a thinner, flexible bow.

Guangdong music gradually evolved into a string ensemble format by the 1960s, led by the [[gaohu]] with ''[[ruan]]'', ''[[qinqin]]'', ''[[yangqin]]'', ''[[sanxian]]'', ''[[yehu]]'', ''[[tiqin]]'' and various [[woodwind instrument|woodwind]] (including ''[[Guan (instrument)|houguan]]'') and [[percussion instrument|percussion]] instruments. [[Alto saxophone]], xylophone, violin, piano, electric guitar, and drum set may also be used, in combination with traditional instruments.

'''Poppers''' are an interesting [[fishing lure]] to add to any tackle box they come in a variety of sizes and colours.  The body is hollow, which keeps it on the waters surface. As you jerk your rod the lure pops along the surface using its concave head which in turn throws up bubbles and splashes which makes this lure very deadly for [[Bass (fish)|bass]] indeed.  The idea behind the lure is that to a predator fish this type of lure looks like a distressed fish.

{{Starbox end}}'''Kepler-46''', previously designated '''KOI-872''', is a stellar system located in the constellation [[Cygnus (constellation)|Cygnus]]. While the first planet in the system to be discovered, Kepler-46 b (previously KOI-872.01), was discovered through the primary data analysis conducted by [[Kepler (spacecraft)|''Kepler'']], an additional planet, Kepler-46 c, was discovered by an outside group using Kepler public data through analysis of [[Transit_Timing_Variation#Transit_timing_variation_method|transit timing variation]]s. While only one planet has been confirmed by the analysis, the study revealed the potential existence of either an unconfirmed planet KOI-872.03 (KOI-872 d) or an [[extrasolar moon]], which if confirmed would be the first-ever moon discovered outside the Solar System.

The host star itself has an age of approximately ten billion years, more than twice the age of the Sun, and has a mass approximately 90% that of the Sun. The star is broadly similar to the Sun in terms of temperature and radius.&lt;ref name=epe&gt;{{cite web | url=http://exoplanet.eu/star.php?st=Kepler-46 | title=Notes for Star Kepler-46 | work=Extrasolar Planets Encyclopaedia | accessdate=May 16, 2012 | author=Schneider, Jean}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Planetary system ==
Planet b is a superjovian gas giant with 6 times the mass of Jupiter. The second planet in the system was among the first to be discovered through the method of [[Transit_Timing_Variation#Transit_timing_variation_method|transit timing variation]]s, and through its confirmation of KOI-872 c with a 99% confidence level has shown that the method of detection may be used to detect future [[extrasolar planet]]s and, possibly, [[extrasolar moon]]s.&lt;ref name=space.com&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.space.com/15631-hidden-alien-planet-gravity-discovery.html | title=Hidden Alien Planet Revealed by Its Own Gravity| work=Space.com | date=May 10, 2012 | agency=Space.com | accessdate=May 10, 2012 | author=Moskowitz, Clara}}&lt;/ref&gt; This second planet exerted a gravitational force on the first planet, orbiting its host star in just 34 days. While this usually occurs on an extremely regular schedule, additional planets within the system can disrupt the time of the transit, and these disruptions can indicate the presence of a planet, even if the disrupting planet does not pass in front of the host star itself.&lt;ref name=space.com /&gt; 

The data show that Kepler-46 c is an approximately Saturn-mass object with an orbital period of 57 days.&lt;ref name=space.com /&gt; As the planet does not itself transit its host star, there is no way of knowing its size (probably a similar size to its sibling). The measurements also suggest the existence of another planet orbiting with a period of about 6.8 days, but this planet is unconfirmed.&lt;ref name=epe /&gt;

The method in which the planet was detected is similar to the way that the planet Neptune was discovered, in which the newly discovered planet is known by its pull on another which is already known to exist.&lt;ref name=crockett-2012&gt;{{cite news | url=http://earthsky.org/space/new-planet-found-in-distant-solar-system-by-its-tug-on-another-world | title=New planet found in distant solar system by its tug on another world | work=EarthSky | date=May 12, 2012 | agency=Earthsky Communications | accessdate=May 19, 2012 | author=Crockett, Cristopher}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Raccoons''''' is a Canadian [[animated television series]] which was originally broadcast from October 21, 1985 to 1991 with three preceding [[television special]]s from its inception in 1980 and one direct to video special in 1984. The franchise was created by [[Kevin Gillis]] with the co-operation of the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Raccoons Get Own Series|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=QH5WAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=M0ENAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4686,902792&amp;dq|accessdate=August 27, 2012|newspaper=The Leader-Post|date=October 18, 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
The series revolves around Bert Raccoon and married couple Ralph and Melissa Raccoon, who Bert is a friend and roommate of. The series mostly involved the trio's efforts against the [[industrialist]] forces of greedy [[aardvark]] [[millionaire]] Cyril Sneer, who usually tries to destroy the forest for a quick buck. However, the Raccoons would always save their forest from Cyril's schemes, with help from their forest friends including Schaeffer, a gentle [[Herding dog|sheepdog]], Cedric, Cyril's college graduate son, and Sophia Tutu, Cedric's girlfriend. But, as the show progressed, Cyril became more of a [[sympathy|sympathetic]] character, eventually becoming an [[anti-hero]].

Lessons featured in the show mainly included [[environmentalism]], but also included other lessons, including [[friendship]], and [[teamwork]]. There were also a handful of episodes that showed flashback footage from previous episodes.

==History==
The ''Raccoons'' franchise was originally conceived by [[Kevin Gillis]] in the 1970s, while appearing in shows like ''[[Celebrity Cooks]]'', and ''[[Yes You Can]]''. The initial idea for the show was created by Gillis and columnist [[Gary Dunford]] (they drew their inspiration for Ralph Raccoon from a dilemma that happened at a [[cottage]] in Ottawa). Dunford backed out, but Gillis took his idea to Ottawa lawyer Sheldon S. Wiseman, who saw a potential in Gillis' idea and put together a large group - animators, musicians, and writers, to create the first special to star the characters known as ''[[The Christmas Raccoons]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wesley|first=David|title=Raccoons Land A Disney Series|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=IaIkAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=sqUFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2868,5854514&amp;dq|accessdate=August 27, 2012|newspaper=The Montreal Gazette|date=December 8, 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Christmas cartoon latest success for TV performer|date=November 13, 1980|newspaper=[[Ottawa Citizen]]|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=b64yAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=c-4FAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5261,4826957&amp;dq|accessdate=2010-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Production on the special began in 1979 and completed in 1980, and the special was shown on the December of that same year on [[CBC Television]]. It was also shown in countries around the world, including the United States and the United Kingdom. The special was a huge hit and resulted in two sequel specials ''[[The Raccoons on Ice]]'' and ''[[The Raccoons and the Lost Star]]'' and a [[direct-to-video]] special, ''[[The Raccoons: Let's Dance!]]''. In 1981, United States TV networks [[CBS]] and [[NBC]] approached Sheldon Wiseman about producing a 13 episode Raccoons TV series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McLaughlin|first=Paula|title=Film company skating on solid ice|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=YKMyAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=2O4FAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1582,174125&amp;dq|accessdate=August 17, 2012|newspaper=Ottawa Citizen|date=November, 2, 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1984, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation and [[Disney Channel|The Disney Channel]] began funding on the TV series, which cost about $4.5 million to make.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Raccoon in TV show Bigtime |date=|work= [[Ottawa Citizen]]|url= http://news.google.co.uk/newspapers?id=xroyAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Wu8FAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3407,435389&amp;dq=the+raccoons+kevin+gillis&amp;hl=en|accessdate=2010-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Forchuk|first=Rick|title=Raccoons Big Success|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=PopWAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=OkENAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3465,3972731&amp;dq|accessdate=August 27, 2012|newspaper=The Leader-Post|date=November 15, 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music===
{{main|List of songs in The Raccoons}}
The series had a [[New Wave music|New Wave]] [[soundtrack]] including the theme song ''&quot;[[Run With Us]]&quot;'' by cast member [[Lisa Lougheed]], which was covered by [[Spray (band)|Spray]] in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.discogs.com/release/827680 Spray - ''Run With Us''], discogs.com&lt;/ref&gt; Season 1 ended with a different version of the song, not sung by Lougheed. ''&quot;Run With Us&quot;'' was performed in Season 1 by [[Stephen Lunt]]. In the first season the [[French Canadian]] singer [[Luba (singer)|Luba]] performed several songs, several of which were later re-recorded by Lougheed for use in other seasons. There were also several other songs performed by other musicians such as [[Rita Coolidge]] and [[Rupert Holmes]] who performed songs for the first special, [[Leo Sayer]] and Coolidge again for the second, and [[John Schneider (television actor)|John Schneider]] and [[Dottie West]] for the last TV special. [[Rory Dodd]], The [[Dior Bros]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://media-imdb.com/name/nm1947225/ The Dior Bros.] @ [[IMDB.com]]&lt;/ref&gt; (actually Kevin Gillis and Jon Stroll under a pseudonym), and several other musicians also had songs performed, although somewhat rarely compared to the aforementioned people.

The earlier version of ''&quot;Run With Us&quot;'', like quite a few of the other songs from ''The Raccoons'', were never officially released. The songs from the first two specials were released on the album ''[[Lake Freeze – The Raccoons Songtrack]]'' in 1983. A soundtrack for the fourth special was released in 1984, but featured vocals from Frank Floyd and Hank Martin to replace John Schneider. Nine of the songs from the series featured on Lougheed's 1988 album ''[[Evergreen Nights]]'', though Lougheed only sang some of the songs (sometimes in duets), while some were sung by other artists ([[Curtis King Jr]] and Stephen Lunt). The French version of ''&quot;Run With Us&quot;'', as well as most of Luba and Lisa Lougheed's songs, was performed by the [[French Canadian]] singer [[Jano Bergeron]] with 'Run With Us' being renamed in French to''&quot;Viens Vers Nous&quot;''.

The instrumental music was composed by Kevin Gillis and Jon Stroll and performed largely by the [[National Arts Centre Orchestra]] from Ottawa, Canada. Most of the instrumental cues heard in the series were actually recorded for [[The Raccoons and the Lost Star]] and re-used. Only two of the instrumental tunes (the opening and closing themes for ''The Raccoons on Ice'') have ever been released officially (they can be found on the ''Lake Freeze'' album).

===Animation===
From 1979-1985, Canadian animation company [[Atkinson Film-Arts]] provided the animation for the four specials and first season of the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Raccoons Are No Bandits|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=L18_AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=OVMMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3558,1564010&amp;dq|accessdate=August 27, 2012|newspaper=The Windsor Star|date=December 19, 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;All episodes in season 1 say in the end credits &quot;Animation Facility: Atkinson Film-Arts&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; In 1986, after producing the first 11 episodes, Hinton Animation Studios took over to animate the remaining seasons of the show (seasons 2-5).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Taylor|first=Noel|title=Cartoon Characters Spawn A New Studio|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=dcQyAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=ou8FAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3839,708074&amp;dq|accessdate=August 27, 2012|newspaper=Ottawa Citizen|date=November 22, 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;All episodes in season 2-5 say in the end credits &quot;Produced at Hinton Animation Studios Inc.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Marion, the county seat of McDowell County, was planned and built on land selected by the first McDowell County Commissioners on March 14, 1844 at the Historic [[Carson House (Marion, North Carolina)|Carson House]] on Buck Creek. It was not until 1845, however, that the official name of Marion was sanctioned as the county seat by the state legislature. The name of Marion came from [[Francis Marion|Brigadier General Francis Marion]], the [[American Revolutionary War]] hero, known as the “Swamp Fox” and the man upon whom the movie &quot;[[The Patriot (2000 film)|The Patriot]]&quot; was based. Over the years, Marion was also home to Sgt. Daniel Kanipe, one of only two survivors of [[General Custer]]'s 7th Cavalry that was massacred at the [[Battle of Little Bighorn]]. An historical marker was placed in front of his former home in 2011. The nearby [[Lake James]] is a popular local and tourist attraction, and has been the backdrop for movies such as [[The Last of the Mohicans (1992 film)|''The Last of the Mohicans'']] and [[The Hunt for Red October (film)|''The Hunt for Red October'']].

Another famous home in Marion is the [[Joseph McDowell House]], built in 1787 by the county's namesake, [[Joseph &quot;Pleasant Gardens&quot; McDowell|Joseph McDowell]]. McDowell played a large role in the [[Battle of Cowpens]] when he helped defeat the British in January 1781. McDowell went on to serve as a member of the North Carolina Constitutional Convention in 1788 and was a member of the 3rd United States Congress. Restoration plans are underway to preserve this historic house and ensure that it remains a vital part of Marion's history. In 2010, the Joseph McDowell Greenway opened to the public along the [[Catawba River]], and will soon link the two most historic homes in McDowell County, the [[Joseph McDowell House]] and the [[Carson House (Marion, North Carolina)|Carson House]].

'''The Big Fire'''

Until the late 19th century, Main Street was a collection of mostly wooden huts, houses, and buildings. On Sunday morning, November 25, 1894 a fire sprang up in an old building known as the “Ark” located behind the Courthouse. The fire spread to Main Street and rushed down the street at an incredible pace. The wooden buildings were quickly consumed by the enormous inferno. The few brick buildings on Main Street were also gutted, and because there was no public water supply, bucket brigades were hurriedly formed to halt the advance of the fire. It was not enough, however, and most of Main Street was burned to the ground. Showing the resiliency possessed by the citizens, the city came together and took on the rebuilding process, making Marion larger and stronger than before. Today, downtown Marion is listed in the [[National Register of Historic Places]].

'''Depression Era &amp; Labor Conflict'''

On Oct. 2, 1929, the McDowell County sheriff and several deputies faced a group of workers outside the fence in front of the Marion Manufacturing Company, whose 600 employees had been on strike for four months. A gunfight quickly ensued between the two groups. Sheriff Oscar Adkins would later swear in court that the strikers opened fire first, although no weapons were ever found on any of the strikers. 36 strikers were shot, 6 mortally, during the confrontation.  [[Sinclair Lewis]] wrote a syndicated newspaper report entitled &quot;Cheap and Contented Labor: The Picture of the Southern Mill Town.&quot;  He concluded: &quot;The workers, especially in Marion, have become discouraged.  They are hungry, tired, bewildered.  They are sick of being shot down.  Unless the whole country encourages them [financially], they will crawl back into the slavery I have sought to picture here.&quot;  However, since the Great Depression was in full force, little such help would arrive.

'''Historic District'''

Eleven structures make up the [[Main Street Historic District (Marion, North Carolina)|Main Street Historic District]] in the downtown area, which was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1991. Four churches, St. John's Episcopal Church (1882), First Baptist (1914), First Presbyterian (1923), and St. Matthews Lutheran (1935); two former hotels, the Eagle Hotel, which survived the 1894 fire, and the Hotel Marianna (1910); a bank on Main Street built in 1903; the McDowell County Courthouse, which was constructed in 1928; the Marion Depot (1860s), which is the oldest surviving depot on the Western Rail Line; the Public Library (1937), which was originally built as a post office; and the Marion Community Building, built in 1937.&lt;ref name=&quot;National Register of Historic Places&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.nationalregisterofhistoricplaces.com/NC/McDowell/state.html| title=National Register of Historic Places: McDowell County |publisher=NationalRegisterOfHistoricPlacesDotCom (a private website mirroring National Park Service NRIS data) | accessdate=2009-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Projects are currently underway to revitalize the downtown area as well as to maintain and restore the character of the long-standing buildings.

'''Marion Today'''

Marion currently stands as a small congenial town at the edge of the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]], &quot;Where Main Street Meets the Mountains.&quot; Just off Interstate 40, Marion is located approximately 35 miles east of [[Asheville, North Carolina|Asheville]] and 20 miles west of [[Morganton, North Carolina|Morganton]].  

Marion serves as a gateway from Interstate 40 to many nearby attractions and recreation activities in the Blue Ridge Mountains.  A contemporary rest area located on the US 221 bypass west of Marion serves as a welcome center for visitors to the area.  The rest area and visitor center is staffed with travel counselors during daylight hours.  In addition to providing visitor information, it also has picnic facilities and vending machines on the premises.

The [[Marion Marauders]], a [[Tar Heel League]] baseball club, were a favorite local attraction in the 1940s and 50s, and was the home team of star pitcher [[Kelly Jack Swift]], who in 1953 became the last minor league pitcher to ever win 30 games in a season, going 30-7 with a 2.54 ERA. [[Sports Illustrated]] published an article about Swift and his accomplishment in its October 17, 2011 edition.

2007 [[Basketball Hall of Fame]] inductee and current [[North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball|University of North Carolina Tar Heels]] basketball coach [[Roy Williams (coach)|Roy Williams]] was born and spent a part of his childhood in Marion. On July 18, 2011, the town held a ceremony to dedicate a [[Carolina blue]] historical marker downtown in front of City Hall, listing Marion as the birthplace of [[Roy Williams (coach)|Coach Williams]], as well as his many awards and accomplishments.  

Marion continues to be a community that values athletics, especially the &quot;Fightin' Titans&quot; of [[McDowell High School (Marion, North Carolina)|McDowell High]], whose girl's basketball team won the 1992 North Carolina 4A State Championship.

==Attractions==

[[Image:Carsonhouse.jpg|thumb|right|The Carson House, built in 1793]]

There are three parks in Marion operated by the city, the main one being downtown beside the Community Building. In 2010, the City opened the [[Joseph McDowell House|Joseph McDowell Greenway]].  Named in honor of the county's namesake, Joseph McDowell, the greenway follows the flow of the Catawba River.  Benches, picnic tables and fishing piers are scattered throughout this first phase with access from Highway 70 between the intersections of Highway 221/226 By-Pass and Roby Conley Road. Historic homes such as the [[Carson House (Marion, North Carolina)|Carson House]] and the [[Joseph McDowell House]] have kept the history of Marion alive for decades, and are open weekdays to the public (the latter currently receiving restoration). In downtown Marion, the beautifully restored Marion Depot, the oldest surviving depot on the Western Rail Line, hosts numerous community events each month, and is available for rental to individuals and groups for meetings, receptions, parties, and other functions. [[Lake James]] provides fishing, camping, and recreation for [[McDowell County, North Carolina|McDowell]] and [[Burke County, North Carolina|Burke]] Counties and is just minutes from Marion. [[Lake Tahoma]], [[Linville Caverns]], [[Linville Falls]], and the [[Blue Ridge Parkway]] are also very close to town, and exhibit the diverse scenery of Western North Carolina. There are also several golf courses outside of town, as well as two waterparks and numerous campgrounds.

==History==
The Arara have been in contact with non-native peoples since the 1850s. They had peaceful encounters with outsiders along the [[Xingu River|Xingu]] and [[Iriri River]]s. From 1889 to 1894, they were harassed by rubber tappers.&lt;ref name=contact&gt;[http://pib.socioambiental.org/en/povo/arara/1237 &quot;Arara: Contact with nacional society.&quot;] ''Povos Indígenas no Brasil.'' (retrieved 17 May 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Language==
Arara people speak the [[Pará Arára language|Arára language]], also known as the [[Ajujure language]], which is a [[Karib language]]. Its [[ISO 639-3]] language code is &quot;aap&quot;. A few Arara people also speak [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]].&lt;ref name=lang/&gt;

'''Theodore Edson Chandler''' (26 December 1894 &amp;ndash; 7 January 1945) was an admiral of the [[United States Navy]] during [[World War II]], who commanded battleship and cruiser divisions in both the Atlantic and Pacific Fleets.  He was killed in action when Japanese [[kamikaze]] aircraft struck his flagship.

He was the grandson of [[William E. Chandler]] (1835–1917)  who served as [[United States Secretary of the Navy|Secretary of the Navy]] during the [[Chester A. Arthur]] administration and a [[U.S. Senator]] from [[New Hampshire]] and [[Lucy Lambert Hale]] (1841–1915).&lt;ref&gt;Bill O'Reilly,&quot;Killing Lincoln&quot; p.285-286, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and career==
Theodore Edson Chandler was born at [[Annapolis, Maryland]], in 1894 on the day after Christmas.  He entered the [[United States Naval Academy]] in July 1911, and graduated on 5 June 1915.  The new officer received orders to report for duty in the [[battleship]] [[USS Florida (BB-30)|''Florida'']] (BB-30). [[Ensign (rank)|Ensign]] Chandler next served briefly on board [[USS New Hampshire (BB-25)|''New Hampshire'']] (BB-25) beginning training in the use of [[torpedo]]es at the end of April 1917. On 2 August, he completed that assignment and, four days later, joined the precommissioning complement of the [[destroyer]] [[USS Conner (DD-72)|''Conner'']] (DD-72), then being fitted out at the [[Philadelphia Navy Yard]].

==World War I and interwar years==
In May 1918, [[Lieutenant junior grade]] Chandler sailed in ''Conner'' to [[Brest, France]], his destroyer's base during the last six months of [[World War I]]. After the [[Armistice with Germany (Compiègne)|Armistice]], his service in [[Europe]]an waters included a brief term as the temporary commanding officer of ''Conner''. 

Chandler returned home in April and, in the following month, reported to the shipyard of the [[William Cramp &amp; Sons Shipbuilding Co.]] to help outfit the destroyer [[USS Chandler (DD-206)|''Chandler'']] (DD-206), named in honor of his late grandfather, former [[United States Secretary of the Navy|Secretary of the Navy]] [[William E. Chandler]]. After her commissioning in September, he served in that ship until December 1920, when he was detached to return to the United States.

On 2 January 1921, he reported for duty at the [[Naval Postgraduate School]] at Annapolis, Maryland, and began a 29-month series of ordnance-related studies.

On 1 June 1923, he completed training duty and, after a brief leave of absence, reported to [[Newport News, Virginia]], on 4 July for duty in conjunction with the outfitting of [[USS West Virginia (BB-48)|''West Virginia'']] (BB-48). The battleship went into commission on 1 December, and Chandler served in her until 16 January 1925 when he transferred to [[USS Colorado (BB-45)|''Colorado'']] (BB-45). 

In June 1926, newly-promoted Lt. Comdr. Chandler came ashore once more for a two-year assignment at the [[Naval Weapons Station Yorktown|Naval Mine Depot, Yorktown]], Virginia. A nine-month tour of duty as gunnery officer in the [[light cruiser]] [[USS Trenton (CL-11)|''Trenton'']] (CL-11) followed. He reported on board [[USS General Alava (AG-5)|''General Alava'']] (AG-5) on 24 April 1929 but was detached only two days later to assume command of [[USS Pope (DD-225)|''Pope'']] (DD-225). 

In October 1930, he began another series of shore assignments, reporting initially to the [[Bureau of Ordnance]] and then to the [[Army Industrial College]] before rounding out duty ashore with a brief tour in the office of the [[Chief of Naval Operations]].

On 30 May 1932, Chandler resumed sea duty as gunnery officer on the staff of the Commander Destroyers [[Battle Force]]. On 2 February 1934, he assumed command of [[USS Buchanan (DD-131)|''Buchanan'']] (DD-131). Between August 1935 and June 1938, he served three successive tours as assistant [[naval attaché]]: first at [[Paris]], then at [[Madrid]], and finally at [[Lisbon]]. 

He arrived in [[Camden, New Jersey]], in June 1938 to help fit out [[USS Nashville (CL-43)|''Nashville'']] (CL-43); and he served as her [[executive officer]] until July 1940. Next, he returned to [[Washington, D.C.]] for a 15-month assignment in the office of the Chief of Naval Operations. Near the end of that tour of duty, he was promoted to [[captain (United States)|captain]] on 18 July 1941.

==World War II==

===Atlantic campaigns===
Chandler relieved Capt. P.&amp;nbsp;P. Powell as commanding officer of [[USS Omaha (CL-4)|''Omaha'']] (CL-4) on 15 October. Shortly over three weeks later, an event occurred that highlighted Chandler's tour in command of the light cruiser.

On the morning of 6 November 1941, ''Omaha'', in company with [[USS Somers (DD-381)|''Somers'']] (DD-381), came across a darkened ship that acted suspiciously when challenged. That ship—although bearing the name ''Willmoto'' and purportedly operating out of [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]]—proved to be the [[Nazi Germany|German]] [[blockade runner]] ''Odenwald'', bound for Germany with 3,857 metric tons of raw [[rubber]] in her holds. Scuttled by her crew, the German ship began to sink; but Capt. Chandler sent a party on the German vessel that controlled the flooding and salvaged the ship. It proved to be the last time that American sailors received [[prize money]].{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

For most of the next 18 months, ''Omaha'' cruised the waters of the [[South Atlantic]] in search of German blockade runners and [[submarine]]s. That tour of duty ended in April 1943, when Chandler was selected to command United States naval forces in the [[Aruba]]-[[Curaçao]] area.

On 3 May 1944, he was promoted to [[Rear admiral (United States)|rear admiral]]. In July 1944, Rear Admiral Chandler took command of Cruiser Division 2 (CruDiv&amp;nbsp;2), [[U.S. Atlantic Fleet|Atlantic Fleet]]. In that capacity, he participated in [[Operation Dragoon]], the invasion of southern [[France]] in mid-August, and commanded the &quot;Sitka-Romeo&quot; force which captured the [[Iles d'Hyeres]] just off the coast of [[Provence]].

===Pacific campaigns===
Shortly thereafter, Rear Admiral Chandler was given command of [[Battleship Division 2]] (BatDiv&amp;nbsp;2) of the [[U.S. Pacific Fleet|Pacific Fleet]]. 

He reported for duty on 2 October in time to command his ships &amp;mdash; part of Rear Admiral [[Jesse B. Oldendorf]]'s bombardment group &amp;mdash; during the [[Battle of Leyte|Leyte invasion]] and helped to repulse the Japanese southern attack group—[[Vice admiral (United States)|Vice Admiral]]s [[Shoji Nishimura]]'s Force “C” and [[Kiyohide Shima]]'s 2d Striking Force—in the [[Surigao Strait]] phase of the [[Battle for Leyte Gulf]].

On 8 December 1944, Rear Admiral Chandler was shifted to command of CruDiv&amp;nbsp;4 and flew his flag above [[USS Louisville (CA-28)|''Louisville'']] (CA-28). During the voyage from [[Leyte (island)|Leyte]] to [[Lingayen, Pangasinan|Lingayen]] for the [[Battle of Luzon|invasion of Luzon]], Chandler's cruisers came under heavy Japanese air attacks—mostly by [[kamikaze]]s. Late in the afternoon of 5 January 1945, a group of 16 suicide planes swooped in on the force then about 100 miles (200&amp;nbsp;km) from [[Manila Bay]]. One of the four successful kamikazes crashed into Rear Admiral Chandler's flagship at her number&amp;nbsp;2 turret, but she continued in her mission. The next day, however, the cruiser suffered more severely during a repeat performance. At 17:30, another suicide plane plunged into the cruiser's starboard side at the bridge. His explosives wrought havoc with the flag bridge where Chandler stood. Even though horribly burned by gasoline flames, Chandler helped deploy fire hoses alongside enlisted men to stop the flames and then waited his turn for [[first aid]] with those same ratings. The admiral, his lungs scorched very severely, was beyond help. He died the next day in spite of the efforts of the medical department. Admiral Chandler is listed on the Tablets of the Missing at the Manila Philippines National Cemetery

==Namesakes==
Two ships in the U.S. Navy have been named after Chandler.  In October 1945, the [[destroyer]] [[USS Theodore E. Chandler (DD-717)|USS ''Theodore E. Chandler'']] (DD-717) was named in his honor.  In 1983, [[Kidd class destroyer|Kidd Class]] guided missile destroyer [[USS Chandler (DDG-996)|USS ''Chandler'']] was named after him.

{{Campaignbox Clan Cameron-Clan Mackintosh feud}}

The Battle of Drumlui was a [[Scottish clan]] battle that took place in either 1330 or 1337, in the [[Scottish Highlands]] between the [[Clan Cameron]] and the [[Clan Mackintosh]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Battle1&quot;&gt;[http://www.clan-cameron.org/battles/1337.html Battle of Drumlui@ClanCameron.org]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The lands around [[Loch Arkaig]] and Glen Loy (''Gleann Laoigh'', sometimes anglicised as Glenlui) had previously been undisputedly owned by the Camerons for many years until they were demanded by William MacKintosh, son of Angus, 6th Chief of Clan MacKintosh. The MacKintoshes appealed to the sword and a battle was fought at Drumlui. The most likely location is Druim Gleann Laoigh, a mountain in the middle of the area in question. The Camerons were defeated under the leadership of Donald Alin Mhic Evin. This battle led to a very long-lasting 350 year feud with the two clans constantly attacking each other until the [[Stand-off at the Fords of Arkaig]] in 1665. &lt;ref name=&quot;Battle1&quot;/&gt;

* Hawkeye 1
* IE D
* Injun 6
* Injun F
* Neutral Point Explorer
* 07325
 
The primary mission objective of Hawkeye 1 (Explorer 52) was to conduct particles and fields investigations of the polar magnetosphere of the earth out to 21 earth radii. Secondary objectives were to make magnetic field and plasma distribution measurements in the solar wind, and to study Type-3 radio emissions caused by solar electron streams in the interplanetary medium. To accomplish these objectives, the spacecraft was instrumented with following instruments:  
* a plasma wave receiver,&lt;ref&gt;http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/experimentDisplay.do?id=1974-040A-03 ELF/VLF Receivers&lt;/ref&gt;
* a fluxgate magnetometer,&lt;ref&gt;http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/experimentDisplay.do?id=1974-040A-01 Triaxial  Fluxgate Magnetometer&lt;/ref&gt; and
* a low energy proton-electron differential energy analyzer.&lt;ref&gt;http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/experimentDisplay.do?id=1974-040A-02 Low-Energy Protons and Electrons&lt;/ref&gt;

The spacecraft was spin stabilized with a nominal rotational period of 11 s. In celestial coordinates, the positive spin axis coordinates were right ascension 299.4 deg (plus or minus 1.1 deg) and declination 8.6 deg (plus or minus 1.5 deg). There was no onboard orientation or spin rate control, but the orientation of the spin axis was stable. An optical aspect system operated from launch until September 3, 1974. After this period, aspect had to be determined from magnetometer measurements. The complete spacecraft with instruments had a mass of 22.65&amp;nbsp;kg. Power of 22 to 36 W, depending on solar aspect, was obtained from solar cells. Hawkeye 1 participated in the International Magnetospheric Study (IMS) and during the first half of 1977 data acquisition was confined to IMS special intervals. Data were obtained in real time only, at frequencies of 136&amp;nbsp;MHz and 400&amp;nbsp;MHz at 100 bit/s (or 200 bit/s with convolutional coding) plus wideband VLF data.

It was designed, built, and tracked by personnel at the Department of Physics and Astronomy, [[University of Iowa]] whose sports teams are the Hawkeyes. The spacecraft was launched on June 3, 1974 into a polar orbit with initial apogee over the North Pole and re-entered on April 28, 1978 after 667 orbits or nearly four years of continuous operation. The spacecraft apogee was between 20.28 and 20.92 Earth radii with less than a 1.7 Earth radii perigee. The orbital period was 51.3 hours. During its lifetime, the inclination of the plane of the spacecraft's orbit to the Earth's equator decreased monotonically from 89.81 to 81.85 degrees. The spacecraft's axis of rotation at launch was inertially fixed in its orbital plane, directed towards a constant right ascension and declination, and nearly parallel to the Earth's equatorial plane.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11426">[[Image:Cuba canna da zucchero.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Sugarcane [[plantation]] in rural Cuba]]'''Agriculture in Cuba''' has played an important part in the economy for several hundred years. Agriculture contributes less than 10 percent to the gross domestic product (GDP), but it employs roughly 20 percent of the working population. About 30 percent of the country's land is used for crop cultivation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://student.britannica.com/comptons/article-229038/Cuba Britannica Online]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The inefficient agricultural industry in Cuba has led to the need to import large amounts of foods.&lt;ref name=&quot;cnnfood&quot;/&gt; [[Cuba]] now imports about 80% of the food it rations to the public.&lt;ref name=&quot;cnnfood&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/americas/04/16/cuba.farming/index.html|title=Cuban leader looks to boost food production|publisher=CNN | date=April 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The rationing program accounts for about a third of the [[food energy]] the average Cuban consumes.&lt;ref name=&quot;wpostsnow&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/07/02/AR2007070201103.html|title=Living on Cuban Food Ration Isn't Easy|publisher=Washington Post | first=Anita | last=Snow | accessdate=2010-04-23 | date=2 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, however, Cuba is dependent on imports for only 16% of its food. &lt;ref&gt;http://monthlyreview.org/2012/01/01/the-paradox-of-cuban-agriculture&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Cuba's agricultural history can be divided into five periods, reflecting [[History of Cuba|Cuban history in general]]:
* Precolonial (before 1492)
* Spanish colonial (1492–1902)
* United States Neocolonial (1902–1958)
* Socialist Cuba, pre-Socialist bloc collapse (1959–1989)
* Socialist Cuba, post-Socialist bloc collapse (1989–present)

During each of these periods, agriculture in Cuba has confronted unique obstacles and undergone numerous challenges.

Before the revolution 1959, the agricultural sector in Cuba was largely oriented towards and dominated by the US economy. After the communist government took over, the [[Soviet Union]] supported the Cuban agriculture by paying premium prices for Cuba's main agricultural product, [[sugar]], and by delivering [[fertilizer]]s. Sugar was bought by the Soviets at more than five times the market price. Also 95 percent of its citrus crop was exported to the COMECON. On the other hand, the Soviets provided Cuba with 63 percent of its food imports and 90 percent of its petrol.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.seattlepi.com/opinion/280951_focus13.html Cuba's agricultural revolution an example to the world - by Andrew Buncombe]&lt;/ref&gt;

After the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, the Cuban agricultural sector faced a very difficult period.After this period to this, Cuba had to rely on sustainable methods of farming. The agricultural production fell by 54% between 1989 and 1994.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;http://www.ers.usda.gov/publications/agoutlook/oct1998/ao255h.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The answer of the Cuban government was to strengthen the base of agricultural biodiversity by making a greater range of varieties of seed available to farmers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cubaagriculture.com/cuba-agriculture-history.htm cuba-agriculture.com - Cuba Agriculture History]&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1990s, the Cuban government prioritized food production and put the focus on small farmers.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; Already in 1994, the government allowed farmers to sell their surplus production directly to the population. This was the first move to lift the state's monopoly on food distribution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE3DC143AF933A25752C0A963958260 The New York Times, January 10, 1995 - Cuba's Agriculture Shows Improvements]&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the shortage in artificial fertilizers and pesticides, the Cuban agricultural sector largely turned [[organic farming|organic]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sustainabilityinstitute.org/pubs/columns/03.24.03Hamilton.html A Different Kind of Green Revolution in Cuba by Hal Hamilton]&lt;/ref&gt; with the [[Organopónicos]] playing a major role in this transition.

Today, there are several different forms of agricultural production, including cooperatives such as [[UBPC]]s (''Unidad Básica de Producción Cooperativa'') and [[CPA (agriculture)|CPAs]] (''Cooperativa de Producción Agropecuaria'').

Some of this is described in the documentary ''[[The Power of Community: How Cuba Survived Peak Oil]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;howcubasurvived&quot;&gt;[http://globalpublicmedia.com/articles/657 The Power of Community: How Cuba Survived Peak Oil]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Urban agriculture==
{{main|Organopónicos}}
Due to the shortage of fuel and therefore severe deficiencies in the transportation sector a growing percentage of the agricultural production takes place in the so-called [[urban agriculture]]. In 2002, {{convert|35000|acre|km2}} of urban gardens produced 3.4 million metric tons of food. Current estimates are as high as {{convert|81000|acre|km2}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seattlepi.com/opinion/280951_focus13.html Seattle Post-Intelligencer]&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Havana]], 90% of the city's fresh produce come from local urban farms and gardens. In 2003, more than 200,000 Cubans worked in the expanding urban agriculture sector.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cubaagriculture.com/agriculture-today.htm Cuban Ministry of Agriculture]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Crops==
===Sugar===
[[File:Cuba Review -Cuban sugar mill.jpg|left|thumb|Cuban sugar mill, ca. 1922.]]
Until the 1960s, the USA received 33% of their [[sugar]] imports from Cuba. However, the sugar production in the [[cane sugar mill]]s has fallen from approximately 8 million metric tons to  3.2 million metric tons in the 2015.

===Tobacco===
[[Image:Tobacco leaves.jpg|right|thumb|120px|Tobacco leaves in a drying shed]]Cuba has the second largest area planted with [[tobacco]] of all countries world wide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationsencyclopedia.com/economies/Americas/Cuba.html Nation´s encyclopedia]&lt;/ref&gt; Tobacco production in Cuba has remained about the same since the late 1990s. Cigars are a famous Cuban product worldwide and almost the whole production is exported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MSN encarta|url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761569844_5/cuba.html|work=|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5kwDZUejX|archivedate=2009-10-31|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The center of Cuban tobacco production is the [[Pinar del Río Province]]. Tobacco is the third largest source of hard currency for Cuba.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cubanet.org/CNews/y00/sep00/07e11.htm Cubanet]&lt;/ref&gt; The income derived from the cigars is estimated at US$200 million.&lt;ref&gt;CNN: The color and complexity of Cuba’s cigars April 9, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The two main varieties grown in Cuba are Corojo and Criollo. 85% of the [[tobacco]] grown in Cuba is produced by [[National Association of Small Farmers]] members.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sinclair&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Sinclair|first=Minor|coauthors=Martha Thompson|title=A Contemporary Cuba Reader: Reinventing the Revolution|publisher= Rowman &amp; Littlefield, |year=2007|pages=158|chapter=Agricultural Crisis and Transformation|isbn=0-7425-5507-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{See also|Cigar#Cuban cigars|l1=Cuban cigars}}

===Citrus===
Cuba is the world's third largest producer of [[grapefruit]]. Sixty percent of the citrus production are [[orange (fruit)|oranges]], 36% grapefruit.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; In the citrus production the first foreign investment in Cuba's agricultural sector took place: In 1991, the participation of an enterprise from Israel in the production and processing of citrus is the ''Jagüey Grande'' area, approximately {{convert|140|km|mi|-1|abbr=on}} east of Havana, was officially recognized.&lt;ref&gt;http://lanic.utexas.edu/project/asce/pdfs/volume11/rossmayo.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The products are mainly marketed in Europe under the brand name ''Cubanita''.

===Rice===

Rice plays a major role in the Cuban diet. Rice in Cuba is mostly grown along the western coast. There are two crops per year. The majority of the rice farms are state-farms or belong to co-operatives.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fao.org/docrep/005/Y4347E/y4347e0j.htm FAO Corporate Document Repository]&lt;/ref&gt; Cuba has been a major importer of rice. Recently, the annual rice imports have approached 500 000 tonnes of milled rice. The production of rice is limited due to the shortage of water and similar to other industries in Cuba the lack of fertilizers and modern agricultural technology. The yield per hectare remains lower than the average of Central American and Caribbean countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fao.org/DOCREP/006/Y4751E/y4751e0t.htm FAO Corporate Document Repository]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Potato===
The per capita consumption of [[potato]]es in Cuba amounts to {{convert|25|kg|abbr=on}} per year. Potatoes are mainly consumed as [[French fries]]. The potato production areas (in total {{convert|37000|acres|km2|disp=or}}) are concentrated in the Western part of Cuba. The main variety grown in Cuba is the [[Désirée potato|Désirée]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://gilb.cip.cgiar.org/confluence/display/wpa/Cuba World Potato Atlas]&lt;/ref&gt; Seed potatoes are partly produced locally. Some 40,000 metric tons of seed potatoes are imported annually from [[New Brunswick]], [[Canada]] and the [[Netherlands]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bismarcktribune.com/articles/2007/05/25/news/state/133853.txt Cuba works toward seed potato deal with North Dakota in: The Bismarck Tribune.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cassava===
[[Image:Manihot esculenta dsc07325.jpg|left|thumb|Unprocessed cassava root]]Some {{convert|260000|acre|km2}} are planted with [[cassava]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://lanic.utexas.edu/la/cb/cuba/asce/cuba6/08messina.fm.pdf Cuba´s Non-Sugar Agriculture]&lt;/ref&gt; The cassava originates from the Latin American and Caribbean region&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ciat.cgiar.org/webciat/asia_cassava/pdf/proceedings_workshop_00/632.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and is grown in almost every country of the region. Cuba is the second largest producer of cassava in the Caribbean with a production of 300,000 t (2001).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foodmarketexchange.com/datacenter/product/feedstuff/tapioca/detail/dc_pi_ft_tapioca_0601.htm Foodmarket Exchange]&lt;/ref&gt; However, the yield per hectare is the lowest of all Caribbean countries. Most of Cuba's production is used directly for fresh consumption.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fao.org/docrep/007/y5271e/y5271e05.htm FAO Corporate Document Repository]&lt;/ref&gt; Part of the cassava is processed to [[sorbitol]] in a plant near Florida, Central Cuba.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.evd.nl/zoeken/showbouwsteen.asp?bstnum=148354&amp;location= EVD - The Netherlands]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tropical fruits===
[[Plantain]]s and [[banana]]s account for over 70 percent of production with plantain 47% and banana 24% of the local production. Both are only produced for domestic consumption.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ers.usda.gov/publications/fts/APR04/fts30902/fts30902.pdf USDA 2004]&lt;/ref&gt; Other tropical fruits produced in Cuba are [[mango]], [[papaya]], [[pineapple]], [[avocado]], [[guava]], [[coconut]], and anonaceae (sugar apple family).

'''Northport''' is a city in [[Tuscaloosa County, Alabama|Tuscaloosa County]] in the west central part of the [[U.S. state]] of [[Alabama]]. Located on the [[Black Warrior River]] across from downtown Tuscaloosa, it is  currently the 24th largest city in Alabama with an estimated population of 23,442 in 2009.&lt;ref name=popest/&gt; It is part of the [[Tuscaloosa, Alabama|Tuscaloosa]] [[Tuscaloosa metropolitan area|Metropolitan Statistical Area]].

==Geography==
Northport is directly adjacent to the larger city of [[Tuscaloosa, Alabama|Tuscaloosa]], and many residents work in Tuscaloosa or other parts of [[Tuscaloosa County]].  Although the two cities do share a land boundary, much of their boundary (and historically all of the boundary) is the [[Black Warrior River]].

According to the [[U.S. Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|14.9|sqmi|km2}}, of which, {{convert|14.6|sqmi|km2}} of it is land and {{convert|0.2|sqmi|km2}} of it (1.48%) is water.

As of the [[census]]{{GR|2}} of 2000, there were 19,435 people, 7,844 households, and 5,255 families residing in the city. The [[population density]] was 1,328.3 people per square mile (512.9/km²).

There were 7,844 households out of which 32.8% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 48.3% were [[Marriage|married couples]] living together, 15.7% had a female householder with no husband present, and 33.0% were non-families. 28.6% of all households were made up of individuals and 9.7% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.41 and the average family size was 2.98.

In the city the population was spread out with 24.9% under the age of 18, 10.5% from 18 to 24, 29.3% from 25 to 44, 21.3% from 45 to 64, and 14.1% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 35 years. For every 100 females there were 83.9 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 79.6 males.

About 11.6% of families and 13.9% of the population were below the [[poverty line]], including 20.4% of those under age 18 and 10.6% of those age 65 or over.

== Culture ==
One of Northport's most notable cultural activities is the Kentuck Festival of the Arts. Each year in October, hundreds of artists gather at Kentuck Park to showcase their work in front of thousands of visitors. The festival celebrates folk and contemporary art as well as traditional crafts. Potters, quilters, and basketmakers offer educational craft demonstrations throughout the weekend. And musical entertainment and culinary offerings are available.

Another longstanding tradition of Northport is Art Night, which is held on the first Thursday of each month. Many of Northport's art galleries open their doors after hours for this event and frequently art or craft demonstrations are offered. A bus system runs between downtown Northport and downtown [[Tuscaloosa, Alabama|Tuscaloosa]] as a collaboration with Tuscaloosa's Art and Soul event.

Dickens Downtown is held the first Tuesday in December. This annual holiday event attracts many thousands of participants to come and see the period setting of 19th-century England.

The Northport Heritage Museum houses a collection of artifacts and photographs that documents the history and evolution of the city.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7901">The '''archdiocese of Acerenza''' is a Roman Catholic ecclesiastical territory  in  southern [[Italy]], included in  the provinces of  [[province of Lecce|Lecce]] and [[province of Potenza|Potenza]]. It has existed as a diocese since the fourth or fifth centuries. In the 11th century it was elevated to an archdiocese. In 1203 it was united with the [[diocese of Matera]] to form the '''archdiocese of Acerenza and Matera'''. This was separated again in 1954, recreating the '''archdiocese of Acerenza''', which briefly became the '''diocese of Acerenza''' in 1976 before reverting to an archdiocese in 1977. Its metropolitan is the [[archdiocese of Potenza-Muro Lucano-Marsico Nuovo]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Catholic Hierarchy&quot;&gt;[http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/diocese/dacer.html Catholic Hierarchy]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Acerenza]] was certainly an episcopal see in the course of the fifth century, for in 499 we meet with the name of its first known bishop, Justus, in the Acts of the Roman Synod of that year. The town was known in antiquity as the &quot;high nest of Acherontia&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[Horace]], Odes, III, iv, 14&lt;/ref&gt;

Acerenza was in early imperial times a populous and important town, and a bulwark of the territory of [[Lucania]] and [[Apulia]]. In the Gothic and Lombard period it fell into decay, but was restored by [[Grimwald]], [[Duke of Beneventum]] (687-689). An Archbishop of Acerenza ([[Giraldus]]) appears in 1063 in an act of donation of [[Robert Guiscard]] to the monastery of the Holy Trinity in [[Venosa]]. 

For a few years after 968 Acerenza adopted the [[Greek Rite]] in consequence of an order of the Byzantine Emperor [[Nikephoros II Phokas|Nicephorus Phocas]] (963-969), whereby it was made one of five suffragans of the [[archdiocese of Otranto]], and compelled to acknowledge the jurisdiction of the [[Patriarch of Constantinople]].&lt;ref&gt;Moroni, Dizionario, L, 63.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pope Urban VI]] (1378–89, Bartolommeo Prignano), was once Archbishop of Acerenza. 

[[Acerenza Cathedral]] is one of the oldest and most beautiful cathedrals in Italy, known for a [[Bust (sculpture)|bust]] long supposed to be that of [[Saint Canius]], patron of the city, to whom the cathedral is dedicated, but now judged to be a portrait-bust of [[Julian the Apostate]], though others maintain that it is a bust of the [[Emperor Frederick II]], after the manner of the sculptors of the Antonine age.

'''William Jefferson''' &quot;'''Bill'''&quot; '''Clinton''' (born '''William Jefferson Blythe III'''; August 19, 1946) is an American politician who served as the 42nd [[President of the United States]] from 1993 to 2001. Inaugurated at age 46, he was the third-youngest president. He took office at the end of the [[Cold War]], and was the first president of the [[baby boomer]] generation. Clinton has been described as a [[New Democrats|New Democrat]]. Many of his policies have been attributed to a [[centrism|centrist]] [[Third Way]] philosophy of governance.

Born and raised in Arkansas, Clinton became both a student leader and a skilled musician. He is an alumnus of [[Georgetown University]], where  he was a member of [[Phi Beta Kappa]] and [[Kappa Kappa Psi]] and earned a [[Rhodes Scholarship]] to attend the [[University of Oxford]]. He is married to [[Hillary Rodham Clinton]], who served as [[United States Secretary of State]] from 2009 to 2013 and who was a Senator from New York from 2001 to 2009. Both Clintons received [[Juris Doctor|law degrees]] from [[Yale Law School]], where they met and began dating. As Governor of Arkansas, Clinton overhauled the state's education system, and served as Chair of the [[National Governors Association]].

Clinton was elected president in 1992, defeating incumbent president [[George H. W. Bush]]. As president, Clinton presided over the longest period of peacetime economic expansion in American history. He signed into law the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]]. He implemented [[Don't ask, don't tell]], a controversial intermediate step to full gay military integration. After the failed [[Clinton health care plan]] attempt, the [[Republican Party of the United States|Republican Party]] won control of the [[United States Congress|Congress]] in 1994 for the first time in 40 years. Two years later, the re-elected Clinton became the first member of the Democratic Party since [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] to win a second full term as president. He successfully passed [[welfare reform]] and the [[State Children's Health Insurance Program]], providing health coverage for millions of children. Later, he was impeached for [[perjury]] and [[obstruction of justice]] in a scandal involving a White House intern, but was acquitted by the [[U.S. Senate]] and served his complete term of office. The [[Congressional Budget Office]] reported a budget surplus between the years 1998 and 2000, the last three years of Clinton's presidency.

Clinton left office with the highest end-of-office [[approval rating]] of any U.S. president since World War II. Since then, he has been involved in public speaking and humanitarian work. Based on his philanthropic worldview, Clinton created the [[Clinton Foundation|William J. Clinton Foundation]] to promote and address international causes such as prevention of [[AIDS]] and [[global warming]]. In 2004, he released his autobiography ''[[My Life (Bill Clinton autobiography)|My Life]]''. He has remained active in politics by campaigning for Democratic candidates, most notably for [[Hillary Clinton presidential campaign, 2008|his wife's campaign for the 2008 Democratic presidential nomination]], and then [[Barack Obama]]'s presidential campaigns in 2008 and 2012. In 2009, he was named United Nations [[Special Envoy of the Secretary-General|Special Envoy]] to [[Haiti]], and after the [[2010 Haiti earthquake]] he teamed with [[George W. Bush]] to form the [[Clinton Bush Haiti Fund]]. Since leaving office, Clinton has been rated highly in [[Historical rankings of United States Presidents|public opinion polls of U.S. presidents]].

==Early life and career==

She left Bill in Hope with grandparents Eldridge and Edith Cassidy, who owned and ran a small [[grocery store]].&lt;ref name=&quot;My Life&quot; /&gt; At a time when the Southern United States was [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregated racially]], Bill's grandparents sold goods on [[credit (finance)|credit]] to people of all races.&lt;ref name=&quot;My Life&quot; /&gt; In 1950, Bill's mother returned from nursing school and married [[Roger Clinton, Sr.]], who owned an [[Car dealership|automobile dealership]] in [[Hot Springs, Arkansas]] with his brother.&lt;ref name=&quot;My Life&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Clinton |first=Bill |title=My Life |publisher=[[Random House]] |year=2004 |isbn=1-4000-3003-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The family moved to Hot Springs in 1950.

[[File:Bill Clinton Boyhood Home in Hope, Arkansas IMG 1515.JPG|thumb|Bill Clinton boyhood home in [[Hope, Arkansas]]]]

Although he assumed use of his stepfather's surname, it was not until Billy (as he was known then) turned fifteen&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oprah.com/omagazine/Oprah-Interviews-President-Bill-Clinton/3 |title=Oprah Talks to Bill Clinton |work=[[O, The Oprah Magazine]] |date=August 2004 |accessdate=December 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; that he formally adopted the surname Clinton as a gesture toward his stepfather.&lt;ref name=&quot;My Life&quot; /&gt; Clinton says he remembers his stepfather as a [[gambler]] and an alcoholic who regularly [[domestic violence|abused]] his mother and half-brother, [[Roger Clinton, Jr.]], to the point where he intervened multiple times with the threat of violence to protect them.&lt;ref name=&quot;My Life&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;First In His Class&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Maraniss |first=David |title=First In His Class: A Biography Of Bill Clinton |publisher=Touchstone |year=1996 |isbn= 0-684-81890-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Hot Springs, Bill attended St. John's Catholic Elementary School, Ramble Elementary School, and [[Hot Springs High School (Arkansas)|Hot Springs High School]]&amp;nbsp;– where he was an active student leader, avid reader, and musician.&lt;ref name=&quot;My Life&quot; /&gt; He was in the chorus and played the [[tenor saxophone]], winning first chair in the state band's saxophone section. He briefly considered dedicating his life to music, but as he noted in his autobiography ''[[My Life (Bill Clinton autobiography)|My Life]]'':
{{quote|&quot;Sometime in my sixteenth year, I decided I wanted to be in public life as an elected official. I loved music and thought I could be very good, but I knew I would never be [[John Coltrane]] or [[Stan Getz]].

But I knew I could be great in public service.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;My Life&quot; /&gt;}}

Clinton has named two influential moments in his life that contributed to his decision to become a public figure, both occurring in 1963. One was his visit as a [[Boys Nation]] senator to the [[White House]] to meet President [[John F. Kennedy]].&lt;ref name=&quot;My Life&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;First In His Class&quot; /&gt; The other was listening to [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]]'s 1963 ''[[I Have a Dream]]'' speech, which impressed him enough that he later memorized it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=It All Began in a Place Called Hope (Archived whitehouse.gov Article) |publisher=[[The White House]] |url=http://clinton4.nara.gov/WH/EOP/OP/html/Hope.html |accessdate=August 30, 2011| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110719152125/http://clinton4.nara.gov/WH/EOP/OP/html/Hope.html| archivedate= July 19, 2011 &lt;!-- DASHBot --&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==College and law school years==
[[File:Clinton at Georgetown 1967.jpg|right|upright|thumb|Clinton ran for President of the Student Council while attending the School of Foreign Service at [[Georgetown University]].]]
With the aid of scholarships, Clinton attended the [[Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service]] at [[Georgetown University]] in Washington, D.C., receiving a Bachelor of Science in Foreign Service (B.S.) degree in 1968. He spent the summer of 1967, the summer before his senior year, [[intern]]ing for Arkansas [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[J. William Fulbright]].&lt;ref name=&quot;My Life&quot; /&gt; While in college, he became a brother of [[Alpha Phi Omega]] and was elected to [[Phi Beta Kappa]]. Clinton was also a member of the Order of [[DeMolay International|DeMolay]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.demolay.org/aboutdemolay/halloffame_bio.php?hofid=18 |title=Bill Clinton Inducted May 1, 1988 |publisher=DeMolay |accessdate=August 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; a youth group affiliated with Freemasonry, but he never became a [[Freemasonry|Freemason]].

Upon graduation, he won a [[Rhodes Scholarship]] to [[University College, Oxford]] where he studied [[Philosophy, Politics and Economics]], though because he had switched programs and had left early for Yale University, he did not receive a degree there.&lt;ref name=&quot;First In His Class&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/09/world/oxford-journal-whereas-he-is-an-old-boy-if-a-young-chief-honor-him.html |title=Oxford Journal; Whereas, He Is an Old Boy, If a Young Chief, Honor Him|last=Dowd|first=Maureen|work=The New York Times |accessdate=July 17, 2009 | date=June 9, 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; He developed an interest in [[rugby union]], playing at Oxford&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Rugby Union for Dummies |author=Cain, Nick &amp; Growden, Greg |chapter=21: Ten Peculiar Facts about Rugby |page=297 |edition=2 |publisher=John Wiley and Sons|location= [[Chichester]], England |ISBN= 978-0-470-03537-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later for the Little Rock Rugby club in Arkansas. While at Oxford he also participated in [[Opposition to the Vietnam War|Vietnam War protests]] and organized an October 1969 [[Moratorium to End the War in Vietnam]] event.&lt;ref name=&quot;My Life&quot; /&gt;

Clinton did eventually move to Texas with Rodham to take a job leading [[George McGovern]]'s effort there in 1972. He spent considerable time in [[Dallas]], at the campaign's local headquarters on Lemmon Avenue, where he had an office. There, Clinton worked with future two-term mayor of Dallas, [[Ron Kirk]], future governor of Texas, [[Ann Richards]], and then unknown television director (and future filmmaker) [[Steven Spielberg]].

After graduating from Yale Law School, Clinton returned to Arkansas and became a law professor at the [[University of Arkansas]]. A year later, he ran for the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] in 1974.

Clinton was elected [[Governor of Arkansas]] in 1978, having defeated the Republican candidate [[Lynn Lowe]], a farmer from [[Texarkana, Arkansas|Texarkana]]. He became the youngest governor in the country at 32.

[[Monroe Schwarzlose]] of [[Kingsland, Arkansas|Kingsland]] in [[Cleveland County, Arkansas|Cleveland County]], polled 31&amp;nbsp;percent of the vote against Clinton in the Democratic gubernatorial primary of 1980. Some suggested Schwarzlose's unexpected voter turnout foreshadowed Clinton's defeat in the general election that year by [[United States Republican Party|Republican]] challenger [[Frank D. White]].

For [[senior citizens]], he removed the [[sales tax]] from medications and increased the home property-tax exemption.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Natural&quot; /&gt;

In the early 1980s, Clinton made reform of the Arkansas education system a top priority. The Arkansas Education Standards Committee, chaired by Clinton's wife, attorney and [[Legal Services Corporation]] chair [[Hillary Rodham Clinton]], succeeded in reforming the education system, transforming it from the worst in the nation into one of the best. Many have considered this the greatest achievement of the Clinton governorship. Clinton and the committee were responsible for state educational improvement programs, notably more spending for schools, rising opportunities for gifted children, an increase in vocational education, raising of teachers' salaries, inclusion of a wider variety of courses, and compulsory teacher testing for aspiring educators.&lt;ref name=&quot;First In His Class&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;The Natural&quot; /&gt; He defeated four Republican candidates for governor: Lowe (1978), White (1982 and 1986), and businessmen [[Woody Freeman]] of [[Jonesboro, Arkansas|Jonesboro]], (1984) and [[Sheffield Nelson]] of Little Rock (1990).&lt;ref name=AllPolitics1 /&gt;

In 1987, there was media speculation Clinton would enter the race after then-[[Governor of New York|New York Governor]] [[Mario Cuomo]] declined to run and Democratic front-runner [[Gary Hart]] withdrew owing to revelations of marital infidelity.

In the first primary contest, the [[Iowa caucus]], Clinton finished a distant third to Iowa Senator [[Tom Harkin]]. During the campaign for the [[New Hampshire primary]], reports of an extramarital affair with [[Gennifer Flowers]] surfaced. As Clinton fell far behind former [[Massachusetts]] Senator [[Paul Tsongas]] in the New Hampshire polls,&lt;ref name=&quot;First In His Class&quot; /&gt; following [[Super Bowl XXVI]], Clinton and his wife Hillary went on ''[[60 Minutes]]'' to rebuff the charges. Their television appearance was a calculated risk, but Clinton regained several delegates. He finished second to Tsongas in the [[New Hampshire Democratic primary, 1992|New Hampshire primary]], but after trailing badly in the polls and coming within single digits of winning, the media viewed it as a victory. News outlets labeled him &quot;The Comeback Kid&quot; for earning a firm second-place finish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.cnn.com/2001-01-11/politics/clinton.nh_1_president-clinton-new-hampshire-bill-clinton |title=Clinton thanks New Hampshire for making him the 'Comeback Kid' |date=January 11, 2001 |accessdate=August 30, 2011 |publisher=CNN }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Winning the big prizes of Florida and Texas and many of the [[Southern United States|Southern primaries]] on [[Super Tuesday]] gave Clinton a sizable delegate lead. However, former California Governor [[Jerry Brown]] was scoring victories and Clinton had yet to win a significant contest outside his native South.&lt;ref name=&quot;First In His Class&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;The Choice&quot; /&gt; With no major Southern state remaining, Clinton targeted New York, which had many delegates.

During the campaign, questions of [[conflict of interest]] regarding state business and the politically powerful [[Rose Law Firm]], at which Hillary Rodham Clinton was a partner, arose.

While campaigning for U.S. President, the then Governor Clinton returned to Arkansas to see that [[Ricky Ray Rector]] would be executed. After killing a police officer and a civilian, Rector shot himself in the head, leading to what his lawyers said was a state where he could still talk but did not understand the idea of death. According to Arkansas state and Federal law, a seriously mentally impaired inmate cannot be executed. The courts disagreed with the allegation of grave mental impairment and allowed the execution. Clinton's return to Arkansas for the execution was framed in a ''[[The New York Times]]'' article as a possible political move to counter &quot;soft on crime&quot; accusations.&lt;ref name = &quot;mbsrgd&quot;&gt;[[George Stephanopoulos]], ''All Too Human: A Political Education'', 1999, ISBN 978-0-316-92919-6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Applebome|first=Peter|title=Arkansas Execution Raises Questions on Governor's Politics|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1992/01/25/us/1992-campaign-death-penalty-arkansas-execution-raises-questions-governor-s.html |work=The New York Times|date=January 25, 1992|accessdate=March 28, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clinton was inaugurated as the 42nd President of the United States on January 20, 1993. Shortly after taking office, Clinton signed the [[Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993]] on February 5, which required large employers to allow employees to take unpaid leave for pregnancy or a serious medical condition. This action had bipartisan support,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=103&amp;session=1&amp;vote=00011 |title=U.S. Senate Roll Call Votes 103rd Congress – 1st Session |publisher=United States Senate |accessdate= August 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and proved quite popular with the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.protectfamilyleave.org/pdf/030608_ncpfl_fmla_national_survey.pdf |title=New Nationwide Poll Shows Strong Support for Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) |publisher=Protect Family Leave |accessdate=August 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 15, 1993, Clinton made his first address to the nation, announcing his plan to raise taxes to cap the [[budget deficit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/15/us/white-house-hones-all-out-campaign-to-sell-sacrifice.html |title=White House Hones All-Out Campaign to Sell Sacrifice |newspaper=The New York Times |date=February 15, 1993 |author=Richard L.

On May 19, 1993, Clinton fired seven employees of the White House Travel Office, causing the [[White House travel office controversy]] even though the Travel Office staff served at the pleasure of the President, who could dismiss them without cause. The White House responded to the controversy by claiming the firings were done because of financial improprieties that had been revealed by a brief FBI investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Hillary Rodham Clinton | authorlink = Hillary Rodham Clinton |title=[[Living History]] |publisher=[[Simon &amp; Schuster]] |year=2003 |ISBN= 0-7432-2224-5 |page=172}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics contended the firings had been done to allow friends of the Clintons to take over the travel business and that the involvement of the FBI was unwarranted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ken Gormley |authorlink=Ken Gormley (academic) | title=The Death of American Virtue: Clinton vs. Starr |publisher=[[Crown Publishers]] |location=New York |year=2010 |ISBN= 978-0-307-40944-7 |pages=70–71}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clinton signed the [[Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993]] in August of that year, which passed Congress without a Republican vote.

Clinton made a major speech to Congress regarding [[Clinton health care plan|a health care reform plan]] on September 22, 1993, aimed at achieving universal coverage through a national health care plan. This was one of the most prominent items on Clinton's legislative agenda, and resulted from a task force headed by [[Hillary Clinton]]. Though at first well received in political circles, it was eventually doomed by well-organized opposition from conservatives, the [[American Medical Association]], and the health insurance industry. However, [[John F. Harris]], a biographer of Clinton's, states the program failed because of a lack of coordination within the [[White House]].&lt;ref name=&quot;The Survivor&quot; /&gt; Despite the Democratic majority in Congress, the effort to create a national health care system ultimately died when compromise legislation by [[George J.

In November 1993, [[David Hale (Whitewater)|David Hale]], the source of criminal allegations against Bill Clinton in the [[Whitewater controversy]], alleged that Clinton, while governor of Arkansas, pressured him to provide an illegal $300,000 loan to Susan McDougal, the partner of the Clintons in the Whitewater land deal.&lt;ref name=&quot;salon031798&quot;&gt;{{cite news|author1=Jonathan Broder |author2=[[Murray Waas]] |url=http://www.salon.com/news/1998/03/cov_17news.html |title=The Road To Hale |publisher=[[Salon.com|Salon]] |date=March 17, 1998 |accessdate= August 25, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] investigation did result in convictions against the McDougals for their role in the Whitewater project, but the Clintons themselves were never charged, and Clinton maintains innocence in the affair.

Clinton signed the [[Brady Bill]] into law on November 30, 1993, which imposed a five-day waiting period on handgun purchases. He also expanded the [[Earned Income Tax Credit]], a subsidy for low-income workers.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Survivor&quot; /&gt;

In December of that year, allegations by Arkansas state troopers [[Larry Patterson]] and Roger Perry were first reported by [[David Brock]] in [[the American Spectator]]. Later known as [[Troopergate (Bill Clinton)|Troopergate]], the allegations by these men were that they arranged sexual liaisons for Bill Clinton back when he was governor of Arkansas. The story mentioned a woman named ''Paula'', a reference to [[Paula Jones]].

That month, Clinton implemented a Department of Defense directive known as &quot;[[Don't Ask, Don't Tell]]&quot;, which allowed [[homosexuality|gay men and women]] to serve in the armed services provided they kept their sexuality a secret, and forbade the military from inquiring about an individual's sexual orientation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Feder | first1 = Jody | title = &quot;Don't Ask, Don't Tell&quot;: A Legal Analysis | publisher = DIANE Publishing | year = 2010 | accessdate = 2012-08-16 | isbn = 978-1437922080}}&lt;/ref&gt; This move garnered criticism from the left (for being too tentative in promoting [[LGBT rights in the United States|gay rights]]) and from the right (who opposed any effort to allow gays to serve). Some gay-rights advocates criticized Clinton for not going far enough and accused him of making his campaign promise to get votes and contributions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Stranger Among Friends. – book reviews |url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1316/is_n11_v28/ai_18855826 |newspaper=[[Washington Monthly]] |author=John Cloud |date=November 1996 |accessdate=August 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their position was that Clinton should have integrated the military by executive order, noting that President [[Harry Truman]] used executive order to racially desegregate the armed forces.

Clinton and most of his allies in the Democratic Leadership Committee strongly supported free trade measures; there remained, however, strong disagreement within the party. Opposition came chiefly from anti-trade Republicans, protectionist Democrats and supporters of [[Ross Perot]]. The bill passed the house with 234 votes against 200 opposed (132 Republicans and 102 Democrats voting in favor; 156 Democrats, 43 Republicans, and 1 independent against). The treaty was then ratified by the Senate and signed into law by the President.&lt;ref name=NAFTA /&gt;

Clinton's 1994 Omnibus Crime Bill made many changes to U.S. law, including the expansion of the death penalty to include crimes not resulting in death, such as running a large-scale drug enterprise. During Clinton's re-election campaign he said, &quot;My 1994 crime bill expanded the death penalty for drug kingpins, murderers of federal law enforcement officers, and nearly 60 additional categories of violent felons.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bill Clinton|url=http://www.4to40.com/legends/print.asp?p=Bill_Clinton|publisher=4to40.com |accessdate=November 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gormley said he was told the details of the bomb plot by Louis Merletti, a former director of the Secret Service. Clinton was scheduled to visit a local politician in central Manila, when secret service officers intercepted a message suggesting that an attack was imminent. A transmission used the words &quot;bridge&quot; and &quot;wedding&quot;, supposedly a terrorist's code words for assassination. The motorcade was re-routed and the US agents later discovered a bomb planted under the bridge. The report said the subsequent US investigation into the plot &quot;revealed that it was masterminded by a Saudi terrorist living in Afghanistan named Osama bin Laden&quot;. Gormley said, &quot;It remained top secret except to select members of the US intelligence community.

On September 21, 1996, barely three years after the &quot;Don't Ask, Don't Tell&quot; imbroglio, and further straining relations with the [[LGBT community]], Clinton signed into law the [[Defense of Marriage Act]] (DOMA), which defines marriage as the legal union of one man and one woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-104publ199/content-detail.html |publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office |title=PUBLIC LAW 104 - 199 - DEFENSE OF MARRIAGE ACT}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul Yandura]], speaking for the White House gay and lesbian liaison office, said that Clinton's signing of DOMA &quot;was a political decision that they made at the time of a re-election.&quot; Administration spokesman [[Richard Socarides]] said, &quot;... the alternatives we knew were going to be far worse, and it was time to move on and get the president re-elected.&quot;&lt;ref name=metroweekly&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.metroweekly.com/feature/?ak=6613 |work=MetroWeekly |author=Chris Geidner |title=Becoming Law |date=September 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clinton himself stated that DOMA was something &quot;which the Republicans put on the ballot to try to get the base vote for President Bush up, I think it's obvious that something had to be done to try to keep the Republican Congress from presenting that.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nymag.com/news/frank-rich/bill-clinton-doma-2012-3/ |work=New York |author=Frank Rich |title=Bill Clinton's shifting justifications for signing the Defense of Marriage Act |date=February 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others were more critical.

In the January 1997 State of the Union address, Clinton proposed a new initiative to provide coverage to up to five million children. Senators [[Ted Kennedy]]&amp;nbsp;– a Democrat&amp;nbsp;– and [[Orrin Hatch]]&amp;nbsp;– a Republican&amp;nbsp;– teamed up with Hillary Rodham Clinton and her staff in 1997, and succeeded in passing legislation forming the [[State Children's Health Insurance Program]] (SCHIP), the largest (successful) health care reform in the years of the Clinton Presidency. That year, Hillary Clinton shepherded through Congress the [[Adoption and Safe Families Act]] and two years later she succeeded in helping pass the [[Foster Care Independence Act]].

====Impeachment====
In a [[lame duck (politics)|lame-duck]] session of Congress after the 1998 elections, the House [[Impeachment of Bill Clinton|voted to impeach Clinton]], based on the results of the [[Lewinsky scandal]].&lt;ref name=&quot;The Survivor&quot; /&gt; This made Clinton only the second U.S. president to be impeached (the first being [[Andrew Johnson]]). Impeachment proceedings were based on allegations that Clinton had lied about his relationship with 22-year-old White House intern [[Monica Lewinsky]] in a sworn [[deposition (law)|deposition]] in the [[Paula Jones]] lawsuit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Time Line |date=September 13, 1998 |page=A32 |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/clinton/timeline.htm |work=The Washington Post | accessdate =January 20, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Starr Report]] was submitted to the House providing what it termed &quot;substantial and credible information that President Clinton Committed Acts that May Constitute Grounds for an Impeachment&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The [[Starr Report]]: The Findings of Independent Counsel [[Kenneth Starr]] on President Clinton and the Lewinsky Affair |year=1998 |ISBN= 1-891620-24-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; the House began impeachment hearings against Clinton before the [[U.S. midterm election|mid-term elections]]. To hold impeachment proceedings, the Republican leadership called a [[Lame duck session (United States)|lame-duck session]] in December 1998.

[[File:Senate in session.jpg|thumb|The impeachment trial of President Bill Clinton in 1999, [[William H. Rehnquist|Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist]] presiding]]

While the [[House Judiciary Committee]] hearings ended in a straight party-line vote, there was lively debate on the House floor. The two charges passed in the House (largely with Republican support, but with a handful of Democratic votes as well) were for [[perjury]] and [[obstruction of justice]]. The perjury charge arose from Clinton's testimony about his relationship to Lewinsky during a sexual harassment lawsuit&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/pjones/pjones.htm |title=Case Closed |author=Dan Froomkin |work=The Washington Post | date=August 26, 1999 | accessdate=August 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; brought by former Arkansas state employee [[Paula Jones]]. The obstruction charge was based on his actions during the subsequent investigation of that testimony.

The Senate later voted to acquit Clinton on both charges.&lt;ref name=senvoteai&gt;{{cite web |author=Senate LIS |title = U.S. Senate Roll Call Votes 106th Congress – 1st Session: vote number 17 – Guilty or Not Guilty (Art I, Articles of Impeachment v.

Many military events occurred during Clinton's presidency. The [[Battle of Mogadishu (1993)|Battle of Mogadishu]] occurred in [[Somalia]] in 1993. During the operation, [[MH-60 Black Hawk|two U.S. helicopters]] were shot down by [[rocket-propelled grenade]] attacks to their [[tail rotor]]s, trapping soldiers behind enemy lines. This resulted in an urban battle that killed 18 American soldiers, wounded 73 others, and one was taken prisoner. There were many more Somali casualties. Some of the American bodies were dragged through the streets&amp;nbsp;– a spectacle broadcast on television news programs. In response, U.S. forces were withdrawn from Somalia and later conflicts were approached with fewer soldiers on the ground. In 1995, U.S. and [[NATO]] aircraft [[1995 NATO bombing campaign in Bosnia and Herzegovina|attacked Bosnian Serb targets]] to halt attacks on U.N. safe zones and to pressure them into a peace accord. Clinton deployed U.S. peacekeepers to Bosnia in late 1995, to uphold the subsequent [[Dayton Agreement]].

{{quote|Together we must also confront the new hazards of [[chemical weapon|chemical]] and [[biological weapon]]s, and the outlaw states, terrorists and organized criminals seeking to acquire them. Saddam Hussein has spent the better part of this decade, and much of his nation's wealth, not on providing for the Iraqi people, but on developing nuclear, chemical and biological weapons and the missiles to deliver them. The United Nations weapons inspectors have done a truly remarkable job, finding and destroying more of Iraq's arsenal than was destroyed during the entire gulf war. Now, Saddam Hussein wants to stop them from completing their mission. I know I speak for everyone in this chamber, Republicans and Democrats, when I say to Saddam Hussein, &quot;You cannot defy the will of the world&quot;, and when I say to him, &quot;You have used weapons of mass destruction before; we are determined to deny you the capacity to use them again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Text of President Clinton's 1998 State of the Union Address |date=January 27, 1998 |author=Bill Clinton |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/states/docs/sou98.htm |work=The Washington Post |accessdate=August 30, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;}}

To weaken Saddam Hussein's grip of power, Clinton signed H.R. 4655 into law on October 31, 1998, which instituted a policy of &quot;regime change&quot; against Iraq, though it explicitly stated it did not provide for direct intervention on the part of American military forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20070218092435/http://www.library.cornell.edu/colldev/mideast/libera.htm |title=Iraq Liberation Act of 1998, H.R.4655, One Hundred Fifth Congress of United States of America at Second Session |publisher=Library of Congress |accessdate=February 18, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c105:H.R.4655.ENR: |title=H.R.4655 -- Iraq Liberation Act of 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; The administration then launched a four-day bombing campaign named [[Operation Desert Fox]], lasting from December 16 to 19, 1998.

===2008 presidential election===
During the [[Democratic Party (United States) presidential primaries, 2008|2008 Democratic presidential primary campaign]], Clinton vigorously advocated on behalf of his wife, [[Hillary Clinton]]. Through speaking engagements and fundraisers, he was able to raise $10&amp;nbsp;million toward her campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2008/07/30/bill-clinton-2007-speech-haul-tops-10-million/ |title=Bill Clinton 2007 speech haul tops $10&amp;nbsp;million |author=Robert Yoon |date=July 30, 2008 |publisher=CNN |accessdate=August 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some worried that as an ex-president, he was too active on the trail, too negative to Clinton rival Barack Obama, and alienating his supporters at home and abroad.&lt;ref name = &quot;CBS-Tarnish&quot;&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/01/26/politics/main3755521.shtml |title=Analysis: Bill Clinton's Lost Legacy |publisher=CBS News |date= January 26, 2008 |accessdate=August 30, 2011 |author=Vaughn Ververs}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many were especially critical of him following his remarks in the South Carolina primary, which Obama won.

==History==
Yunxiao County, located on the [[Zhang River]] and on the way from [[Zhangpu County]] to Dongshan Island, was the earliest seat of the government of Zhangzhou. The famous Weihui Temple is situated here. It was dedicated to the founder of Zhangzhou.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chinats.com/zhangzhou/intr1300.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The temple is very famous as a tourist attraction for local and overseas visitors. In the main hall is a statue of Chen Yuangguang in red armour and official crown with his heavy mustache and red face. Sculptures of his parents and wife are also located in the temple. The couplets hung on the stone pillars inside the hall.  The temple walls are full of praise for Chen for being the first to open up southern Fujian. The most festive period for the temple is  on Chen's birthday (the 15th day of the second lunar month) and the anniversary of his death (the 5th day of the 11th lunar month). On both occasions the temple is packed with people burning incense and full-length operas that are performed in the square. Effigies of Chen and other deities are paraded down the streets to celebrate the occasions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chinats.com/zhangzhou/intr1303.htm China Travel Service - Destination Guide - Fujian - Zhangzhou -Introduction&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Lisa Ono was born in [[São Paulo]], [[Brazil]], in 1962 but moved with her family to [[Tokyo]] at the age of 10.  From that time on she spent half of every year in [[Japan]], and half in [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Brazil]]. 

Although she lived in Brazil for only a short time, she was turned into a type of &quot;MPB ([[Brazilian popular music]]) ambassador&quot; in Japan, influenced by her father, who owned a club while living in Brazil, and was also [[Baden Powell de Aquino]]'s agent.&lt;ref&gt;http://lisaono.homestead.com/aboutlisa.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Lisa began singing and playing the guitar at age 15, and her debut as a professional Bossa Nova singer was in 1989. Her natural voice, rhythmic guitar playing, and her charming smile led her to a huge success and popularized Bossa Nova in Japan. She has performed with many top musicians such as [[Antônio Carlos Jobim]] and [[João Donato]], and has been performing enthusiastically in New York, Brazil and Asian countries. The 1999 album ''Dream'' sold more than two hundred thousand copies in Japan, and since then she has established a determined position in the Japanese Bossa Nova community.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.onolisa.com/english/biography.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
After moving to Japan, Lisa's father opened a new venue called Saci-Pererê, a Brazilian [[restaurant]] where she started performing mainly bossa nova and [[samba]].  Besides singing, Lisa Ono plays the [[guitar]] and is a [[songwriter]]. Her first album, ''Catupiry'', was released in 1989. She has not stopped recording since then, releasing one disc a year, mostly in Portuguese. She soon became famous in Japan after appearing in several TV commercials. 

In 1991 her album ''Nanã'' won the &quot;Grand Prix Gold Disk Award for Jazz&quot; in Japan.  Her third album ''Menina'' was recorded in Rio de Janeiro, and won the same Grand Prix award. In 1992, Ono released her second album on the [[BMG]] label called ''Serenata Carioca'', and she also released her first book ''Felicidade''. In 1994 she released ''Esperança'', with guest appearances by [[Tom Jobim]], [[Sivuca]], [[Paulo Moura]], [[Danilo Caymmi]] and [[Mario Adnet]]. In 1993, she made ''Minha Saudade'', dedicated to works by [[João Donato]], who also wrote the arrangements. In 1996, [[Antonio Adolfo]] co-produced her CD ''Rio Bossa''. In 1998, Ono released the album ''Bossa Carioca'', produced by [[Paulo]] and [[Daniel Jobim]]. She also started a label, ''Nanã'', aimed at promoting Brazilian music in Japan. 

In 1999, [[Oscar Casto-Neves]] co-produced her CD ''Dream'', which sold over 200,000 copies. This album was made in America, and contains classic American songs and film music from the 1940s–50s done with bossa nova arrangements. In July 2000, Ono continued her exploration of songs in English with the release of ''Pretty World'', co-produced by Eumir Deodato. 

In the fall of 2000 she released ''Boas Festas'', a &quot;winter bossa&quot; album to celebrate the Christmas season. The album includes original tunes as well as fresh bossa arrangements of classic American Christmas carols. Continuing her exploration of new material, in the summer of 2001, Lisa released ''Bossa Hula Nova'', which as the title name implies, includes some new and classic Hawaiian songs done in a bossa nova style. This album includes arrangements by [[Mário Adnet]], who appears on many of her recordings. In March 2002, Lisa released ''Lisa Ono Best 1997-2001''. This album also includes two wonderful new live songs recorded on Lisa's &quot;winter bossa&quot; tour in December 2001. In July 2002, Lisa released ''Questa Bossa Mia'' (''This Is My Bossa Nova''). This CD features a new musical destination - [[Italy]]! Mário Adnet is once again involved. 

In 2003 she released the album ''Dans Mon Île'' (French for &quot;In my island&quot;), themed around a voyage to [[France]] and based on famous [[French language|French]] songs. Joining her once again is the Brazilian composer and arranger Mário Adnet. Guest musicians include [[Pierre Barouh]], [[Richard Galliano]], and [[Henri Salvador]], who also performs a duet with Lisa on &quot;J'ai Vu&quot;. In the summer of 2004, Lisa released ''NAIMA-meu anjo'', a collection of African and Arabic songs done in a bossa nova style. In November 2004, Lisa released her newest CD ''Boas Festas 2'' - ''Feliz Natal''. On this album Lisa returns to Brazil with a new &quot;winter bossa&quot; collection of Christmas songs in English and Portuguese recorded with three of Brazil's top guitarists - [[Toninho Horta]], [[Oscar Castro-Neves]], and [[Romero Lubambo]]. 

Lisa announced the birth of her second child, a boy, on October 7, 2004. 

Lisa has performed with [[Tom Jobim]] and with [[João Donato]] in Brazil, in addition to other performances around the world.  Appearances in Japan include concerts at the Blue Note Tokyo with [[Paulo Jobim|Paulo]] and [[Daniel Jobim]], [[Toninho Horta]], and [[Emílio Santiago]]. 

In addition to making guest appearances on other recordings, Lisa has also created music for [[television commercial]]s in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;http://lisaono.homestead.com/aboutlisa.html&lt;/ref&gt;

As of November 2007, she has released 22 albums.

In 2009, from January to April, Ono held her Asian tour from Beijing, Shanghai, Hong Kong, Taipei, to Bangko. On March 4 of 2009, her two new albums, ''Cheek To Cheek – Jazz Standards from RIO –'' and ''Look To The Rainbow – Jazz Standards from L.A. –'' were released at the same time. The theme of both albums is jazz music, and features arrangers from Brazil and Los Angeles. In May 2009, Lisa started Lisa Ono Concert Tour 2009 – Jazz Standards -, a tour to celebrate her two new albums.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.onolisa.com/english/biography.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2012, Ono served on the judging panel of [[Asian Wave (season 1)|the first season]] of a Chinese singing-survival show ''[[Asian Wave]]'' which was broadcast on [[Dragon Television]] from 5 September.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sunwoo|first=Carla|title=Lee Min-woo is singing show judge|url=http://koreajoongangdaily.joinsmsn.com/news/article/article.aspx?aid=2958219|accessdate=29 September 2012|newspaper=Joongang Daily|date=22 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Champ Car Grand Prix of Road America''' was an [[open wheel car]] race held on the [[Road America]] circuit in [[Elkhart Lake]], [[Wisconsin]]. It was a round of the [[Champ Car|Champ Car World Series]] for most of Champ Car's existence, the first race being held in [[1982 IndyCar season|1982]]. Prior to its cancellation in 2008 with the absorption of the Champ Car circuit into the rival [[Indy Racing League]], the race at Road America had been held annually every year since with the exception of [[2005 Champ Car season|2005]].

==2003 event==
The 2003 event almost didn't take place. [[Mario Andretti]] was instrumental in keeping Champ Car racing at [[Road America]]. [[Champ Car|CART]] had severed its ties with the track as a legal resolution of payment issues from the prior year's race and for the upcoming 2003 event. Andretti acted as an intermediary between CART President Chris Pook and Road America President George Bruggenthies. After six weeks of negotiations both sides came to terms and signed a two year contract in April 2003. The 2003 event was named the &quot;Mario Andretti Grand Prix of Road America&quot; in honor of Andretti's efforts.&lt;ref name=&quot;Road America back on CART schedule&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/motor/cart/2003-04-23-road-america_x.htm |title=Road America back on CART schedule |publisher=[[USA Today]] |date=2003-04-23 |accessdate=2010-06-05 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5zFiOdNST |archivedate=6 June 2011 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was not the end of troubles, though.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1904">'''Roy F. Schwitters''' (born 1944, [[Seattle]]) is a [[professor]] of [[physics]] at the [[University of Texas at Austin]].  He was formerly a professor of physics at [[Harvard]] and [[Stanford]].  His undergraduate and doctoral degrees are both from [[MIT]].

During the events leading up to the project's cancellation, Schwitters was famously quoted, &quot;The SSC is becoming the victim of the revenge of the C students.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm W. Browne, &quot;Scientist at Work: Roy F. Schwitters&quot;, The New York Times, [http://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/23/science/scientist-at-work-roy-f-schwitters-building-a-behemoth-against-great-odds.html?scp=1&amp;sq=Schwitters&amp;gwh=EDF3A3B47EF4089BCD531F12766327A5&amp;pagewanted=all March 23, 1993]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Wing On Bank''' (永安銀行) was a bank in [[Hong Kong]] that collapsed in 1986. It was majority owned by [[Wing On Holdings]], a listed vehicle 68.8% controlled by the Kwok family, including [[Kwok Lam-po]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.police.gov.hk/offbeat/634/letter.html Appointment of Deputy Commandant, Hong Kong Auxiliary Police Force (Arthur Kwok Chi-shun)]. Offbeat&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The bank was founded by the Kwok family, led by Kwok Lok (郭樂) (aka Guo Luo) and Kwok Chuen (郭泉) (aka Guo Chuan) in 1931, growing out of an insurance operation on the back of the successful [[Wing On]] [[department store]].&lt;ref name=EoMC&gt;[http://www.scribd.com/doc/30821927/Encyclopedia-of-Modern-China-Vol-4-part-1 Encyclopedia of Modern China, Vol 4, part 1]&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Collapse===
The bank collapsed in 1986 when its auditors had qualified the 1985 accounts on fundamental uncertainty,&lt;ref&gt;[http://sunzi1.lib.hku.hk/newspaper/view/05_02.08/104520.pdf $154m rights issue may be rejected], [[The Standard]], 27 May 1986
&lt;/ref&gt; and its shareholders voted against a [[special resolution]] on capital injection of HK$154 million.

The [[Hang Seng Bank]] stepped in and bailed out the lender with a cash injection of HK$150 million in December 1985.&lt;ref name=injection&gt;
K. C. Ching, [http://sunzi1.lib.hku.hk/newspaper/view/05_02.10/104748.pdf Bank buyer found - but not named], The Standard, 30 April 1987&lt;/ref&gt;

Hang Seng assumed management control of the failed bank in June 1986, injected a total of HK$330 million,&lt;ref name=closed&gt;Financial Editor, [http://sunzi1.lib.hku.hk/newspaper/view/05_02.10/104729.pdf 'Closed' signs at three Wing On branches], [[South China Morning Post]], 4 January 1987&lt;/ref&gt; and rapidly returned it to profit. A number of unprofitable branches were closed down.&lt;ref name=closed/&gt; The injection was transformed into a 50.3% stake,&lt;ref name=injection/&gt; which was sold on.

The [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|Legislative Council]] approved an appropriation of HK$10 million to investigate possible criminal acts that might have caused the collapse of this and two other institutions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sunzi1.lib.hku.hk/newspaper/view/06_03.01/96549.pdf $636m write-offs amid attacks on 'speculation], The Standard, 9 October 1986&lt;/ref&gt; The Commercial Crime Bureau was brought in, and investigators established the bank had collapsed on doubtful loans of $275 million relating to the personal affairs of Albert Kwok the General Manager, who died in April 1986.&lt;ref name=closed/&gt;

[[Dah Sing Bank]] became the eventual owners of the bank.

The '''Wietze''' is a river, 29 kilometres long, in the South [[Lüneburg Heath]], in [[Lower Saxony]], Germany.

The river rises east of the [[Soltau]] suburb of Moide and flows from there in a southerly direction to [[Wietzendorf]]. Here it is joined by the only tributary of any size, the Aue. The Aue has two source streams: the Hötzinger Aue, which rises north of [[Hötzingen|Stübeckshorn]], 98 m above [[Normalnull|sea level]] and the Alvernsche Aue, that has its source northwest of [[Munster (Örtze)|Alvern]], 86 m above sea level. Beyond Wietzendorf the Wietze swings east, passes the village of [[Reddingen]] and flows through its attached hamlets of Halmern and Reiningen and past the Winterhoff farm. It then turns again towards the south and discharges into the [[Örtze]] at [[Müden (Örtze)|Müden]]. 

The Wietze is a very clean river. It is water quality class II through (moderately polluted, -betamesosaprob-) &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nlwkn.niedersachsen.de/master/C35959472_L20_D0_I5231158_h1.html NLWKN water quality map]&lt;/ref&gt;  Between Wietzendorf and Velligsen the river can be used by [[canoe]]s. It is looked after by the Örtze maintenance division which is based [[Faßberg]]. 

There is a river of the same name that also flows through the Lüneburg Heath, but discharges into the River [[Aller]] - see [[Wietze (Aller)]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2116">In [[sign language]], '''mouthing''' is the production of visual [[syllable]]s with the mouth while signing. Although not present in all sign languages, and sometimes not in signers at all levels of education, where it does occur it may be an essential (that is, [[phonemic]]) element of a sign, distinguishing signs which would otherwise be [[homophone]]s; in other cases a sign may seen to be flat and incomplete without mouthing even if it is unambiguous.

Mouthing often originates from oralist education, where sign and speech are used together. Thus mouthing may preserve an often abbreviated rendition of the spoken translation of a sign. In educated [[Ugandan Sign Language]], for example, where both English and [[Luganda|Ganda]] are influential, the word for {{sc|very}}, [[Stokoe notation|Av&quot;]], is accompanied by the mouthed syllable ''nyo'', from Ganda ''nnyo'' 'very', and {{sc|abuse}}, jO*[5]v&quot;, is accompanied by ''vu'', from Ganda ''onvuma''. Similarly, the USL sign {{sc|finish}}, t55bf, is mouthed ''fsh'', an abbreviation of English ''finish'', and {{sc|deaf}}, }HxU, is mouthed ''df''. 

However, mouthing may also be [[iconicity|iconic]], as in the word for {{sc|hot}} (of food or drink) in [[ASL]], [[Stokoe notation|UtCbf&quot;]], where the mouthing suggests something hot in the mouth and does not correspond to the English word &quot;hot&quot;.

Mouthing is an essential element of [[cued speech]] and simultaneous sign and speech, both for the direct instruction of oral language and to disambiguate cases where there is not a one-to-one correspondence between sign and speech. However, mouthing does not always reflect the corresponding spoken word; when signing 'thick' in [[Auslan]], for example, the mouthing is equivalent to spoken ''fahth''.

'''''Grevillea'' 'Peaches and Cream'''' is new and much sought after [[grevillea]] cultivar which has been recently{{when|date=January 2011}}  released in Australia.

It is a shrub that grows to 1.2 by 1.5 metres (4–5&amp;nbsp;ft) in height and width and has bright green attractive deeply divided leaves, around {{convert|11.7|cm|in|sigfig=2}} long by {{convert|6.4|cm|in|sigfig=2}} in width. The foliage takes on a bronze sheen in winter. The [[inflorescence]]s are about {{convert|15|cm|in|sigfig=2}} long by {{convert|9|cm|in|sigfig=2}} wide and open yellow initially but later add various shades of pink and orange.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last = McCarthy | first = Norm | title = A New Garden of Grevillea in Toowoomba | journal = Grevillea Study Group Newsletter | volume =  | issue = 74 | pages = 14 | publisher = ASGAP | year = 2006 | url = http://asgap.org.au/ASGAP/grev66.pdf |format=PDF| id = ISSN 0725-8755 | accessdate = 2007-05-22}} {{Dead link|date=November 2010|bot=H3llBot}}

The cultivar is a cross between a white-flowered form of the Queensland species ''[[Grevillea banksii]]'', and ''[[Grevillea bipinnatifida|G. bipinnatifida]]'' from Western Australia, and was selected from a plant which arose in a garden in [[Burpengary, Queensland|Burpengary]], a northern suburb of Brisbane, in 1997. It was watched and propagated by Queensland horticulturists and [[Association of Societies for Growing Australian Plants|SGAP]] members Dennis Cox and Janice Glazebrook, finally being patented in 2006.&lt;ref name=patent/&gt;

It is of the same parentage as [[Grevillea 'Superb'|'Superb']]  and [[Grevillea 'Robyn Gordon'|'Robyn Gordon']] and has similar prolific and sustained flowering. ''Grevillea'' 'Superb' has a deeper orange coloration in the flowers, while ''G.'' 'Robyn Gordon' is red.

Its small size lends itself to use in a small garden, and it is bird attracting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| last = Stewart| first = Angus| authorlink = Angus Stewart| title = Gardening Australia Fact Sheet: The Home Garden | work = Gardening Australia Website  | publisher = [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]| date = 8 September 2007| url = http://www.abc.net.au/gardening/stories/s2027109.htm

Although not yet recorded, the cultivar is very similar to several cultivars which have been known to cause allergic [[contact dermatitis]] for certain individuals who come into contact with it, so caution is advised.

The [[Metrolink (Southern California)|Metrolink]] '''Ventura County Line''' is a [[commuter rail]] line serving [[Ventura County]] and the [[San Fernando Valley]] in [[Los Angeles County]] and the [[Los Angeles, California|City of Los Angeles]], in the [[Southern California]] system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Metrolink, The commuter railroad serving Los Angeles |url= http://www.trains.com/trn/default.aspx?c=a&amp;id=401 |first= Matt Van|last= Hattem|date= June 30, 2006 |work= Trains Magazine|  accessdate= 2006-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Schedules==
Metrolink trains on the Ventura County Line run weekdays only, mostly during peak [[commuter]] hours, and so with limited midday service. From [[Union Station (Los Angeles)|Union Station]]—[[Downtown Los Angeles]] (as 7-2011): 
;East Ventura
*six trains total at peak hours, in the peak direction only (3 south-AM; 3 north PM) each weekday, running to [[East Ventura (Metrolink station)|East Ventura station]] (in the community of [[Montalvo, California|Montalvo]]) — northern end of line.
;Moorpark
*four trains each weekday run to [[Moorpark (Amtrak station)|Moorpark Station]] (far western Simi Valley) — also station for Amtrak Pacific Surfliner. Trains of the six East Ventura runs also stop here.
;Chatsworth
*three trains each weekday run to [[Chatsworth (Amtrak station)|Chatsworth Station]] (western SFValley) — major transit hub, with the Amtrak [[Pacific Surfliner]], the [[Orange Line (Los Angeles Metro)|Metro Orange Line]] (6-2012) and [[Metro Local (Los Angeles County)|Metro Local]] valley bus lines, the [[LADOT Commuter Express]] service; and buses from [[City of Santa Clarita Transit|Santa Clarita Transit]], and [[List of small Southern California transit agencies#Simi Valley Transit|Simi Valley Transit]]. Trains of the six East Ventura and four Moorpark runs also stop here.
;Airport
*six trains each weekday run to Burbank-[[Bob Hope Airport]] (900 numbered series).

===Other service===
Service is augmented during midday and on weekends by the [[Amtrak]] [[Pacific Surfliner]] line, serving most of the Metrolink stations on the Ventura County Line. 

;Airport
Additional airport shuttle service operates between Union Station and Bob Hope Airport station as the '''Burbank-Bob Hope Airport Line'''—'''BUR'''. Metrolink numbers Airport Line trains in the 900 series.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.metrolinktrains.com/schedules/html.php?id=701&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tracks==
Metrolink owns the tracks between Moorpark and Los Angeles Union Station. It uses the [[Coast Line (UP)|Coast Line]] of the [[Union Pacific Railroad]] between Moorpark and [[Oxnard]] where the Santa Paula Branch splits from the rest of the Coast Line. The [[East Ventura (Metrolink station)|East Ventura Station]] and layover facility are on the Santa Paula branch line.

==History==
{{seealso|CalTrain}}
Service on this line began in 1992 as one of Metrolink's original three lines, with service from [[Moorpark]] to [[Los Angeles Union Station]] in [[Downtown Los Angeles]]. The line was extended to [[Camarillo]] and [[Oxnard]] in 1994 after the [[Northridge earthquake]], then to [[East Ventura (Metrolink station)|East Ventura]] in 2002.

===Accidents===
{{main|2008 Chatsworth train collision}}
At 4:23 p.m. on September 12, 2008, 25 people were killed in a collision between Metrolink commuter train 111 and a freight train. At least 130 people were injured, with at least one dying later at a hospital. The crash occurred on the Ventura County Line near Heather Lee Lane, south of the Ronald Reagan (118) Freeway and east of Topanga Canyon Boulevard.  Both locomotives, the leading car of the commuter train, and seven cars of the freight train were derailed.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10265">The New Kingdom followed the [[Second Intermediate Period of Egypt|Second Intermediate Period]] and was succeeded by the [[Third Intermediate Period of Egypt|Third Intermediate Period]]. It was [[Egypt]]’s most prosperous time and marked the peak of its power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Shaw |editor-first=Ian |title=The Oxford History of Ancient Egypt |year=2000 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0-19-815034-2 |page=481 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The later part of this period, under the Nineteenth and Twentieth Dynasties (1292–1069 BC) is also known as the ''Ramesside period'', after the eleven pharaohs that took the name of Ramesses.

Radiocarbon dating suggests that the New Kingdom may have started a few years earlier than the conventional date of 1550 BC. The radiocarbon date range for its beginning is 1570–1544 BC, the mean point of which is 1557 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Bronk Ramsey et al., [http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.1189395 Radiocarbon-Based Chronology for Dynastic Egypt], ''Science'' 18 June 2010: Vol. 328. no. 5985, pp. 1554-1557.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Possibly as a result of the foreign rule of the [[Hyksos]] during the Second Intermediate Period, the New Kingdom saw Egypt attempt to create a buffer between the [[Levant]] and Egypt, and attained its greatest territorial extent. Similarly, in response to very successful 17th century attacks by the powerful [[Kingdom of Kush]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Alberge|first=Dalya|title=Tomb reveals Ancient Egypt's humiliating secret|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/uk/article1955811.ece|date=July 28 2003|accessdate=2013|work=The Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; the New Kingdom felt compelled to expand far south into [[Nubia]] and hold wide territories in the [[Near East]]. [[Military history of Ancient Egypt|Egyptian armies]] fought [[Hittites|Hittite]] armies for control of modern-day [[Syria]].

==Eighteenth Dynasty==
{{further|Amarna Period}}
The [[Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt|Eighteenth Dynasty]] started from 1550 BC and contained some of Egypt's most famous [[pharaoh]]s, including [[Ahmose I]], [[Hatshepsut]], [[Thutmose III]], [[Amenhotep III]], [[Akhenaten]] and [[Tutankhamun]]. [[Queen regnant|Queen]] Hatshepsut concentrated on expanding Egypt's [[external trade]] by sending a commercial expedition to the [[land of Punt]]. 

Thutmose III (&quot;the [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] of Egypt&quot;) expanded Egypt's army and wielded it with great success to consolidate the [[List of largest empires|empire]] created by his predecessors. This resulted in a peak in Egypt's power and wealth during the reign of Amenhotep III. During the reign of [[Thutmose III]] (ca. 1479-1425 BC), [[Pharaoh]], originally referring to the king's palace, became a form of address for the person who was king.&lt;ref&gt;Redmount, Carol A. &quot;Bitter Lives: Israel in and out of Egypt.&quot; p. 89-90. ''The Oxford History of the Biblical World.'' Michael D. Coogan, ed. [[Oxford University Press]]. 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;  

One of the best-known 18th Dynasty pharaohs is [[Amenhotep IV]], who changed his name to [[Akhenaten]] in honor of the [[Aten]] and whose exclusive worship of the Aten is often interpreted as history's first instance of [[monotheism]]. Akhenaten's religious fervor is cited as the reason why he was subsequently written out of Egyptian history. Under his reign, in the 14th century BC, [[Egyptian art]] flourished and attained an unprecedented level of realism.

Towards the end of the 18th Dynasty, the situation had changed radically. Aided by Akhenaten's apparent lack of interest in international affairs, the [[Hittites]] had gradually extended their influence into [[Phoenicia]] and [[Canaan]] to become a major power in international politics—a power that both [[Seti I]] and his son [[Ramesses II]] would need to deal with during the 19th dynasty.

==Nineteenth Dynasty==
{{main|Nineteenth Dynasty}}
[[Image:Hitt Egypt Perseus.png|thumb|left|Egyptian and Hittite Empires, around the time of the [[Battle of Kadesh]].]]
[[Ramesses II]] (&quot;the Great&quot;) sought to recover territories in the Levant that had been held by the 18th Dynasty. His campaigns of reconquest culminated in the [[Battle of Kadesh]], where he led Egyptian armies against those of the [[list of Hittite kings|Hittite king]] [[Muwatalli II]] and was caught in history's first recorded military ambush but Ramesses was able to rally his troops and turn the tide of battle against the Hittites thanks to the arrival of the Ne'arin. The outcome of the battle was undecided with both sides claiming victory at their home front, ultimately resulting in a peace treaty between the two nations.

Ramesses II was also famed for the huge number of children he sired by his various wives and [[concubine]]s; the [[KV5|tomb]] he built for his sons, many of whom he outlived, in the [[Valley of the Kings]] has proven to be the largest funerary complex in Egypt.  

His immediate successors continued the military campaigns, although an increasingly troubled court&amp;mdash;which at one point put a usurper ([[Amenmesse]]) on the throne&amp;mdash;made it increasingly difficult for a pharaoh to effectively retain control without incident.

==Twentieth Dynasty==
The last &quot;great&quot; pharaoh from the New Kingdom is widely regarded to be [[Ramesses III]], a [[Twentieth dynasty of Egypt|Twentieth Dynasty]] pharaoh who reigned several decades after Ramesses II.

In the eighth year of his reign the [[Sea Peoples]] invaded Egypt by land and sea. Ramesses III defeated them in two great land and sea battles. He claimed that he incorporated them as subject peoples and settled them in Southern Canaan although there is evidence that they forced their way into Canaan. Their presence in Canaan may have contributed to the formation of new states, such as [[Philistia]], in this region after the collapse of the Egyptian Empire. He was also compelled to fight invading [[Libu|Libyan]] tribesmen in two major campaigns in Egypt's [[Nile Delta|Western Delta]] in his sixth year and eleventh year respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Nicolas Grimal, A History of Ancient Egypt, Blackwell Books, 1992. p.271&lt;/ref&gt;  

The heavy cost of these battles slowly exhausted Egypt's treasury and contributed to the gradual decline of the Egyptian Empire in [[Asia]]. The severity of these difficulties is stressed by the fact that the first known labor strike in recorded history occurred during the 29th year of Ramesses III's reign, when the food rations for Egypt's favored and elite royal tomb-builders and artisans in the village of [[Deir el Medina]] could not be provisioned.&lt;ref&gt;William F. Edgerton, &quot;The Strikes in [[Ramses III]]'s Twenty-Ninth Year,&quot; ''JNES'' 10, no. 3 (July 1951), pp. 137-145.&lt;/ref&gt; Something in the air prevented much sunlight from reaching the ground and also arrested global tree growth for almost two full decades until 1140 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Frank J. Yurco, &quot;End of the Late Bronze Age and Other Crisis Periods: A Volcanic Cause,&quot; in ''Gold of Praise: Studies on Ancient Egypt in Honor of Edward F. Wente'', ed: Emily Teeter &amp; John Larson, (SAOC 58) 1999, pp. 456-458.&lt;/ref&gt; One proposed cause is the [[Hekla 3 eruption]] of the Hekla volcano in Iceland but the dating of this remains disputed.

Following Rameses III's death there was endless bickering among his heirs. Three of his sons would go on to assume power as [[Ramesses IV]], [[Rameses VI]] and [[Rameses VIII]], respectively. However, at this time Egypt was also increasingly beset by a series of droughts, below-normal flooding of the [[Nile]], famine, civil unrest and official corruption. The power of the last pharaoh, [[Ramesses XI]], grew so weak that in the south the [[High Priests of Amun at Thebes]] became the effective ''de facto'' rulers of [[Upper Egypt]] while [[Smendes]] controlled [[Lower Egypt]] even before Rameses XI's death. Menes eventually founded the [[Twenty-first Dynasty of Egypt|Twenty-First dynasty]] at [[Tanis, Egypt|Tanis]].
